0,"ah yeah
we gon' pump this up one time
as we set it off a little like this kick it
pump it up now it's a big daddy thing
as we send this out to new york city
can't forget the posse down in philly
also in detroit it's a big daddy thing
chicago atlanta ga
sendin this out to miami it's a big daddy thing
tampa can't forget virginia and north carolina
la and oakland it's a big daddy thing
and the rest of the world as we go a little somethin' like this
it's a big daddy thing

let it rain let it rain to be put it pain
with nothin' to gain under the wrath of kane
cause you can't maintain i drained every brain
to leave a stain plain to remain in my lane
or path or road until the next one be sewed
that the b-i-g d-a-double-d-y explode
just like a bomb in vietnam so hit the alarm
or be funky like a underarm
and allow me to show how the microphone should flow
now competition bow to me like a buddha
the teacher the tutor
they come a dime a dozen but the kane look cuter
and i ain't about that slouchin or crabbin
so save it -- cause that's one thing i ain't havin'
because the purpose i serve is to please ya
rhymes will ease ya like milk of magnesia
so bust a pimp without a limp
and i crush any wimp that would try to attempt to umm
get loose i put a boost and used to chill
the comp to kane i picked beetlejuice

big daddy thing 2x

i'm just that ruthless to leave ya toothless
'cause you're useless makin' up excuses excuses
so never touch tap tangle or tamper
a fearless fly foe'll get slapped with a pamper
'cause i can dig in your face like root canal
but i'ma chill won't even dispute you now
actin' wild just ain't my style
cause only the live will be movin the crowd but see
quiet as kept not like a starter you
but i can roast an mc like a barbecue
in the dead zone you shouldn't have left home
steppin to the man now get the head flown
i bring the terror horror there's no tomorrow
child you shouldn't even bother
to press up and get broken like a lee nail
so let me school ya plus scoop your female
just like a jiggalo but i'm much bigger though
i'm like a hitman pullin the trigger slow
and smooth to the groove with lyrics that sooth
and improve with every move that's why you've
been enhanced by the mentally divine
so play football and let's go the nine
shorts i take none 'cause i ain't the one
in eighty-nine there's damage bein done
and for you to diss me will be very risky
'cause i make this be as strong as whiskey
to break and make my foes dispose in force
so y'all can see how me the kane will just reign
superior 'cause i ain't even hearin ya
save the yang 'cause it's a big daddy thang

big daddy thing 4x then cut and scratched to end

and this one here goes out to my man mad money murph
can't forget big sha big therm
and also i got to say whassup to my man horace
got nice and smooth in the place to be
mack daddy nick know what i'm sayin'?
can't forget my man ant live
and of course the one and only prince paul peace",1
1,"here comes the conquering brother that fathoms and never ceases
violators pick up the pieces uh
that are left behind as you're left to find
the fury of the five fingers of death are mine
rippin' on the microphone receitin' poem
givin' competition a big daddy syndrome
some step up mmm none kept up mmm
they rap a brief moment and then shut up
lips are sealed because all of this is real
i'm not about frontin' i tell the real deal of society what
so how we livin'
like a turkey on thanksgiving or like robin gibbons?
not to offend
i just want you to comprehend every message i send tell 'em
'cause i don't understand i have to wonder damn
how could this lifestyle be fun to man
to see a brother gettin' paid undercover
sellin' drugs to one another
'cause all the glamour you get is miscillaneous
and all the product you sell is real dangerous
like um um let's say un poison
destruction to all your own boys and girls who like to buy and give it a try
admire and can't deny the high that's why they soon die
these are the games that a fool would play today
for our own kind to decay
no sign of brotherly love
just scavengers in search of

another victory cut and scratched

when i'm ridin' in my volvo cops harass me
they never ride past me they hound me like lassie
wantin' to give me a summons or a ticket
huh i got a place for them to stick it kick it
they can't understand to see a black man
drivin' a car that costs 25 grand
the first thing they say is where'd you steal her?
and then they assume that i'm a drug dealer
huh that just makes me wanna laugh
'cause now i'm a star and your son got my autograph
so all the cops on the highway gettin' me
my name ain't kieth so could you please stop sweatin' me
so i can flow and go on so on and so on
to all the jams cee throw on
reachin' a summit as you learn from it
a lesson taught from yours truly so here cometh
the royal majesty others have to be
fully prepared though they still won't last with me
so when you hope to hang or even handle
i'll show the meaning of power and just cancel period
out of order conquer and slaughter
you're comin' up shorter boy you'll need more to
compete 'cause the heat is deep in concrete
defeat bring up the fleet flee 'fore we meet
or stay away puttin' new rhymes on layaway
then come get this when you're ready for business
'cause ah yeah i'm with this i'm ready
yo mister cee what is this?

mc's and enemies i freeze at 32 degrees
because they can't drop rhymes like these
competition never saw none done
so pay attention as i mention the 411
just the other day i heard a brother say
taxi cabs don't even come my way
they all be afraid they won't get paid
so they zoom right past and pick up a lighter shade
and if they stop the first thing they want
no more than two people and the money up-front
treatin' me like i'm some type of thug
it might sound bugged but they don't wanna get mugged
who's in the right or wrong? it's time to unite along
the righteous with a walk in success and be strong
instead of lookin' for someone to beef with
a brother like the big daddy kane is peace with
rappers of today like kid'n'play
hey even my man ll cool j
stetsasonic and epmd
public enemy and bdp
salt 'n' pepa 'cause we can't sever never
wheihter whatever we better stand together
that means unite not fightin' or fussin' or cussin'
save all the base for the pipe and start lovin'
one another 'cause separation is a flaw
so endure for more and stop lookin' for

repeat chorus till end",1
2,"the kiss of death on a rap pick
then you get a slap quick so guard it with chapstick
in other words protect and hold your own
it only takes one punch to get the head flown
fists of fury suckers get buried
cause the kane got more spice than curry
i am the flavor down on paper
and nothing could save ya from catchin the vapors
rhymes that'll sting your face like a quick jab
and i'm rubbin 'em in just like vicks say i'm
captivatin dominatin innovatin illustratin fascinatin
motivatin elevatin terminatin mutilatin
rhymes they're worth their weight in
gold bold never sold to a bidder
that claim to glitter you're so bitter like kitty litter
as for damage don't tell me what another do
'cause i quote that i'm r-a-w
so make room cause fighters are doomed
try to consume and make your own tune
a grave from a casket a tisket a tasket
you're rhymes out of basket boy you get your ass kicked
for frontin like you hittin hard
when your arms are too short to box with god
so don't even touch 'cause i come with too much
address and bless any mic that i clutch
and for a rapper to challenge my freestyle
he must be senile and that's why meanwhile
back at the ranch
there goes the asiatic chosen one that's expandin with a new branch
so many slept on the nonchalant act
now wake up sucker this is mortal combat

i seize and freeze mc's with these degrees
put me to my knees or at ease chillllld please
i break it down to bring on the next act
rappers are so full of shit they need ex-lax
so stop griffin your mind is driftin
prepare yourself 'cause i get swift and
captivate the crowd but you can't understand
at times i gotta say to myself god damn
as i get hot and still be gettin' warmer
and i don't have beef with no other performer
keep to myself never bother another
but if a rapper tries to diss i crush the motherfucker
frontin mc's that be tryin' to riff
need to save it and don't even play with
me when i react like a volcano eruptin
i step to you and say now what's up? then
every word'll be just like surgery
cuttin' you open so rush to emergency
or even bow to your knees and below
or get played like a game of nintendo
j-o-k-e-s ain't my style
i ain't a child that's why i don't smile
i combine a line designed to find behind the mind
so devine the other rappers resign
as i go on from night to morn
beginning to end from knowledge to born
whenever rappers are lookin' for static
looks like a job for king asiatic
n-e send me competitors
then again it might just be better to
just slow down you don't wanna throwdown
i get busy get you dizzy like a merry-go-round
feel the wrath of a big daddy raw rhyme
and competition prepare for wartime
be alert for where i drop the bomb at
as i destroy you with mortal combat

i roll so bold with soul control the whole patrol
of folders molders towin black gold
so let it be said let it be read
'cause i lead ahead of others who rhymes are old as pro-keds
tryin' to diss the big daddy repetoire
moi??
you steady screamin out a antique segment wrote
as i just play 'em like a pregant roach and stomp em
for tryin' the forbidden
your rhymes ain't hittin boy you won't be gettin'
none of or in front of cause every one of
my adversaries lack you little son of
o-bit-uary column and read your name
if you ever try to step to the big daddy kane
so any claimin or aimin to be champion
against me? psssh can't be one
i rank supreme and it's a rapper's dream
to scheme and fiend for my technique but redeem
cause there's only room for one teacher
wise words from a wise man'll reach ya
i teach freedom justice and equality
peace to the brothers and sisters that follow me
plenty poisoned minds of the people are ours
slaves from mental death in power
that's the reason before i drop this bomb
i say peace to the nation of islam",1
3,"on and on and on and on
me say the beat don't stop until the break of dawn
nor does the growth of our young world
yes the children be buildin each boy and girl
cause you are the cream of the planet earth
the new birth now take that for what it's worth
and give the child room to blossom and bloom
livin' large it's your destiny to consume
to take flight and ignite to a brand new height
cause that's your goal in life - am i right? yeah
to start reachin' come on each and every
single one of y'all comprehend what i'm teachin
i said listen up listen up listen up youngster
learn from a lesson that the big daddy brung ya
it's nothin' but knowledge i shall bring to you
and i'm not mr rogers or captain kangaroo but i know",1
4,"minister farrakhan
so out of the mercy of allah
and the law written in our nature
we call an individual into existence
and when that individual i make no apologies
for what i'm about to say

big daddy kane
rough rugged and real you're on standstill
to obey okay so let the man build
words of rapture that you have to capture
and i just slapped ya
with the hand full of literature
that's dope def fresh hype choice smooth and raw
rappers i replace rub out and erase
competition you must be on freebase
smokin' or chokin bound to be broken
man get your damn hands off the mic that i'm chokin
'cause i got a strangehold
you're still cold off the road for the role you stole
rhymes that you yell out but you did sell out
crossed-over lost over here now get the hell out
i'm not a pop star rock'n'roller
i'm a rebel blessed able to hold a
mic like a hammer and drop grammar
treat a rapper like a wrestler and body slam him
those who dispute get treated just like a prostitute
they get the boot and played like a flute
so just play mute don't even whisper
open your mouth to speak and i'm diss ya
ragtag and dog put you in the morgue
because you're petty confetti and not ready to rock steady
in other words you're half-steppin'
tiptoein get goin' because my weapon
is not a nine an uzi or a shotgun
but when it come to hype rhymes i got one
just like the album is still the same
_long live the kane_ ain't a damn thing changed
i still get ill and kill at will and build the skill
to fill your grill so don't tell me you're real
we sample beats you sue and try to fight us
tchk maaaan you still be home with arthritis
if we didn't revive em bring back alive
old beats that we appreciated you wouldn't survive
you'd be another memory to us
ashes to ashes and dust to dust
so understand the way that i live
that's positive - and the message i got to give
it's a benefit for you and me
i'm talkin' bout peace
the chosen one that has turned a new leaf
i got gold teeth and they don't chew beef
no pork on my fork strictly fish on my dish
the kane fallin' victim? tchk sucker you wish
i flow like water slaughter
put you out of order floored ya
rappers are raggin and taggin and snaggin and braggin
to be on the bandwagon but i'm the last dragon
with the knack to attract the pack
so just get back i'm young gifted and black

and just go with the flow you know
in the place to be with my man marley marl
sendin this out to divine force
can't forget my main man heavy d
and to my good brothers epmd
and to my man ice-t over on the west coast
can't forget kool moe dee busy bee mc lyte the audio two
i say peace",1
5,"well excuse me take a few minutes to mellow out
big daddy kane is on the mic and i'ma tell about
a minimum length of rhymes of strength
and power so listen to the man of the hour
flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
sing hoe swing low then yo the show
will go on as i perform
transformin on stage like a decepticon
but i'm not animated like a cartoon
i'm for real shootin lyrics like a harpoon
across the crowd the listeners the spectators
so let's groove with the smooth operator",1
9,"here we go here we go on the smooth side
let's take a ride in stride and i'm the guide
with the source and of course - i don't wanna be the king or boss
i just wanna get my point across
'cause it's time to organize and open your eyes
realize we on the rise
to the climax time to take charge
whoever said we can't live large?
to seek out fortune without distortion
and stop livin' for just a small portion
there is a move to make we gotta take a chance to break
all chains become awake
cause this is the new way to be proud and brave
and i ain't goin' out like a slave
in eighty-nine i'm livin' like a champ
step out my face talkin' 'bout a food stamp
child please put it at ease
freeze it's time to get paid in times like these
we can't take shorts or take a loss
so take it from the kane and go for yours because

uh-huh
there comes a time where we can't be in the rear
we gotta step up front to get our share
make the change 'cause we're not inferior
for example there was a black ms america
let's start to do for ourself
we can't depend on no one else or the board of health
so hold your own or else you're gonna find
that if you play off of crime you go out like aunt jemimah
we gotta put it in overdrive and strive to survive


to stay alive that's the reason i've
came to motivate us to the length
effort of strength makes you grow inch by inch
takin' no mediums or small at all
we gotta walk not crawl or else take a fall
what used to be just hopes and thoughts
are now in effect and we can't take shorts because

swing on that right there pump it up here we go
uh-huh uh-huh pump it up here we go
one more thing
let's unite together we can't sever never
no matter what or what-ever
because we need unity to find justice
just i see equality so bust this
take a stand and command to demand what's grand
i know we can if we just understand
the true way of livin' that was really meant for us
so one more time kick the chorus

ah keep it goin' y'all
a prince paul rulin 'em all y'all
a prince paul schoolin 'em all y'all
and tony tony tony tony
and tony tone never leavin' the girls alone
tony tone never leavin' the girls alone
and you don't stop and you don't stop
and you don't stop and you don't stop",1

when you commit yourself to someone
and don't even know wrong from right wrong from right
looks like my feelings been united with you baby
but maybe just a little bit too soon
i realized that hearts get broken sweetheart
i couldn't stand the wound can't stand the wound
so i put mines in your hands girl
and it's all yours my dear
but you got to be gentle 'cause it's fragile see
that means handle with care handle with care
heh reminisce on how i first met you
you remember -- backstage at my show
i thought that i was the star until i saw you
but i did not love her i did not love her
escapin from the crowd to be alone witchu
'cause i had oh so much to say
as we sat down in my dressin room girl huh
and just talked the entire night away
from that moment on i felt that i knew you

verse 1 big daddy kane

na-na-na now girls step up the quick ones kept up
the slow ones need to pep up to keep big daddy's rep up
'cause i don't let up or get up or even set up
on a a speak freak i know how to make you shut up
gasp your breath as you huff and puff
the big daddy got more than enough good stuff
'cause i'm just like secret when it comes to trimin'
strong enough for a man but made for women
so come one come all i'm not about bein' picky
it only takes a hickey to make you want a quickie
&gtfrom the cameo haircut man that's dark and lovely
smooth and suave that's why girls dream of me
and not to flaunt i love a flirt with a skirt
and after a concert a little neeeaaah don't hurt
just to hear the girls screamin' out wild g
you're not a jungle brother but that's some jimbrowski
i'm like a pimp see and iff you tempt me
i can fill up any girls that's empty
give you somethin' that's mighy and strong
but ladies don't get me wrong
because you say that i love 'em and leave 'em but no i please ya
and then catch amnesia
but the party people can't be denied
so i remember those who's on my side

'cause i'm one hype one brown-skinned brother
for those who don't know me i'm who? scoob lover
a jolly good fellow flowin' with the mellow
for all the choice cuties i'd love to say hello
so take away the 3 let's stick to 1 2
me and you now here's a clue what we could do
it begins with an s and ends with an x
hmmm not the number 6 so guess what's next
so girls don't barge don't blink be still
'cause it's about time for scoob to get ill
remeber you dissed now you wanna kiss
write me fan letters sayin' that you miss

you get jacked if you ever try to nap
on a a rap from scrap because you know there's no haps
now right from where i left off to all those who stepped off
you know you had it comin' the blame is what you slept off
?destruction played a part on roll here's so to say?
you can't mislead me why? 'cause i know the way
always gave headahces never known for heartaches
time and effort huh that's what a star takes
let me give you a true piece of mind
'cause this rare species is so hard to find
i'm custom-made for all the ladies with guts
a tall box of hair or rather cameo cuts
draggin' tattoes is what the girls found
two on m chest one draggin' on the ground
to all the young ladies that's clean and legit
as long as i got a face you got a place o sit
no tokens for heart-broken turnstiles
no remarks or regrets but i'll burn while
those that's destined to question for a new thing
join us in harmony together as we sing
for all the ladies determined that once was
so jealous stop searchin' now 'cause

outro big daddy kane

you don't stop you don't stop
you keep on to the break of dawn",1
15,"come get some you little bum
i take the cake but you can't get a crumb
from the poetic authentic superior
ultimate - and all that good shit
i'm the original asiatic acrobatic
there you have it now get dramatic
creatin' drama when i'm on the scene
and i pack 'em in mean like bruce springsteen
i profile a style that's mild and meanwhile
put on trial a rap pile to exile
make you tumble and stumble in a rumble just crumble
and i'm still calm and humble
you need another helpin hand to swing on
i stand alone but still you gotta bring on
your batman and robin cagney and lacey
starsky and hutch but they still can't face me
and if may make this one thing here clear
that's for you not to come near period
so i ain't buggin or delirious
my swift tongue's like a sword that's how severe it is
and i can slice and dice a fisher price mc
that thought he was nice into minute rice
single-handed i ain't with that band stuff
cause cee'll scratch a record like flakes of dandruff
and the mic i ravage not like a savage
but in my own way of doin' damage
as i design the genuine line
now who flattop rules in eighty-nine?

warm it up kane 16x



take two other men with soul that you probably know
deadly as scarface but bright as the cosby show
don't attack rappers but make everyone hush
they step to me but can't stop the bumrush
i make material rich and imperial
the unique technique i speak is all original
you like to sag and drag and gag
same old same old but poppa's got a brand new bag
so put the mic down boy you can't work it


due to wack lyrics it's bout to short circuit
so toss the sauce across to the boss no remorse
you lost with force of course a holocaust
first i caught ya then put ya through torture
you moved wrong my son so i taught ya
just like a guardian that put your body in
the mood to groove with the smoove way that i'm partyin
competition may find it spectacular
scheme and fiend to take a bite like dracula
and waste the taste cause ain't no sugar here
so come near if you dare you booga bear
you start hallucinatin like magic
the wrath gets tragic but kane won't have it
cause you tried to juice me when you're bluffin
slowed the pace so i had to start rushin
so pick a vc date 'cause you're history
here comes kane scoob scrap jay and mister cee
and this is one thing to us we ain't new to
the crew'll cast a spell on the crowd just like voodoo
i'm the man you can't hold back
and all competition appears to be weak
i meant to say wack a vision of blur
just them thinkin' i'm competitin i say huh

warm it up kane 16x



genuine for eighty-nine you know what i'm sayin'?
as i give a shout out to my man tony a
tony p sally sal and the whole libra digital posse
can't forget my man yawnski
and smooth the barber you know what i'm sayin'?
also i gotta say whassup to born true b-boy
and my man big jay cee
the whole rest of the crew scoob lover my brother
scrap lover and dj mister cee
can't forget supreme abu melquan and shabazz
wally d and the rest of the brothers
and of course my little brother the little daddy shane

east oakland yeah that's right
5 years ago i continued to rock
and if you haven't yet heard my name
it was all in the papers on the evening news
i was stone cold in the game
around that time a friend of mine
my homeboy lionel b hooked me up like this yoo
on the stage just rockin' the beat
some say i have a dirty mind

time after time line after line
talking 'bout the bitches that are on your mind
do they call you $hort because of your height or your width
dis me boy i'll hang your balls from a cliff
wrapped around a slinky you're a dinky
it's an easy task to the corner cause the curb didn't want your ass
your name is yuck mouth you don't brush
gotta cover your mouth like this
they call you yuck mouth
you refuse to brush no sweetheart you can keep that kiss
you're a freak with no tale
you have no ass class you can't pass your simply trash
you're a typical nigga the kind you don't take home
???? tights and barbie from the dangerous zone
like a $hort dogg that carries fleas
you make my ass itch twitch don't you wish you could scratch it
and grab it like you want it
the name fits cause your all up on it

and most definitely not a dick pleaser
you dreaming and scheming and fiending for my lust

for you i feel disgust
wait smoke things i hate
for goodness sakes if i wanted someone small i would masturbate
i'm not talking 'bout your height weight or what you dream
when i say too short you know what i mean
you see i need man not a boy to approach me
your lame game really insults me
your name is too $hort or shall i say too skinny
if size were money honey you wouldn't have a penny
little boy your not a player
i'm your savior
to try to get at me shows of gracious behavior
i have to sit on my feet to come down to your level
your mother should have hung you from her umbilical cord
if she would have known your mission
okay little boy here's a proposition
you wanna bit of danger step you to my zone
you call yourself a dogg thatz how i'll send you home
with your tail between your legs screeching and whining
jealous of you got some nigga please your lying
'cause i fight the feeling that would have to be one
and mathematically me plus you equals none

rappin' 4 tay
i am the rapper that they call 4 tay
i'm gon tell you like my homie $hort dogg would say
hoes in the world trying to play it sweet
knowing damn well that they wanna freak
some do this for maybe a week
and then it's cool to get up under the sheets
trying to work that thang but she said no
that's about as far as it's going to go
so i toss and turn to make it loose
finally she feels the act right juice
some of you hoes say oh that's nasty
back of your coat say sweet and sassy
24 deep that's how you sleep
undercover freak every day of the week
you see some of you freaks just need to quit it
playing that role like you ain't with it
the rest of you freaks just won't admit it
especially when you know just who can get it
ain't body tripping 'cause i know i'm right
you could be black or you could be white
for a low bass girl it really don't take to long
but a low bass girl's always trying to turn ya on
with a little squeeze but it's just a tease
give it some time she'll be on her knees
then i'll pick her up so i can work the butt
baby i just wanna try to bust a nut
but don't get me wrong cause you started it all
coming to my house in a cam or ??sump??
but when it's time for me to shove
then you front on all that love
first you said that i deserve it
now you fight don't want to serve it
gave it some time so make up your mind
don't fight the feeling this time to own whine
you was talking 'bout you gunna give my some
but i'm rappin' 4 tay it don't make me numb

too $hort
yeah man the little hoes got ill
so now it's time to get way to real
i know they never have some real dick
they need to quit talking that childish shit

my little dick'll have you screaming though
because when it comes to sex you don't know what's up
your still playing that finger fuck
see i'm a grown man
i bust some young cock out
i like big butts not big mouths
i know some little girls'll break you down in bed
pull your drawers down give you some head
but little girl you wanna have some fun
you better go to magic mountain 'cause your way too young
so at this point i can't really say shit
ain't dropping no lines i'll just call you a bitch bitch",1

7,"city of dope i call it oak

fat ropes shattered hopes
fresh cars and all that dope
baseheads keep the trade alive
nobody know about a 9 to 5
everybody's just trying to survive
you need a gun can't use those knives
you got a bullet? well just pull it
and if you trip get pistol-whipped
by a psychomaniac sick in his head
wanna be a gangster now he's dead
his brother took over ain't no sweat
bought a new drop-top white corvette
now he's buying keys making g's
and all the girls say won't you please
take me in the city of dope

see i'm hard as hell no ghetto tale
you play a gun but the game is real

so cool don't even trip

a resident in the city of dope
and every day i'm selling coke

in the city of dope

life in a coke town heard it before
think it's all been said but it's so much more
it's like midnight slanging rock
task force just hit the block
time to make a move the spot got hot
you chase a cop homeboy why not?
she lit the match and light the crack
ain't giving no bitches no kind of slack
or if you're playing the game you're thinking the same
goddamn that rock cocaine
i've seen a lot of my friends go off that pipe
and every night smoke coke that's white
so when you get up man there you go
you and that pipe just dogging the hoes
in the city of dope and the story goes
want to be like free breaking millions of loaves
in the city of dope where the color is gold
on your neck and your fingers and your brand new rolls
enough said but my rap won't end
it's on a one way trip to san quinten
like you my friend ain't nothing new
you want to grind that boat till it's way past two
you say it's not easy that you're so hard
sporting gold tone z's not credit cards
got clout turn 'em out you got bitches
you say you're not fake but i'm telling you this is
the city of dope might be your world
get a beeper homeboy and just sell that girl
i'm from the town called the city of dope
it couldn't be saved by john the pope
so go on live your life of crime
the beat'll keep beating while i say my rhyme
in the city of dope

smoking weed rolling 'em fat
you wonder where the boy learned to act like that
hey was raised in the ghetto and felt the need
to roll a fat joint and smoke that weed
but the tale goes on and years went by
another drug came and the boy got high
ever since that day he just wasn't the same
where i come from we call it rock cocaine
where you come from you might call it crack
but wherever he went you see he never came back
i tried to tell the motherfucker but he don't know
i say to coke pimp that ho
i don't live in a mansion but i drive a benz
cut to the turf and collect my ends
say look here freak kick me down
i don't have time to talk right now

she was this girl that i know named jane
she used to be cool now the girl's insane
now all jane does is walk around all day
sayin' beam me up scotty take me away
now i remember jane from back in the day
when she used to go to school get all straight a's
now you see jane on the street corner
stoppin' every car anytime she wanna
whatever went wrong the facts remain
but who could think this woulda happen to sweet old jane

jane stop this crazy thing [x2]

jane's lifestory was a tragic one
she started gettin' high 'cause she said it was fun
there was no party just a meeting of friends
and then the question arose who got ends?
it went around they had 300 in all
somebody yelled out we're gonna have a ball
steve grabbed the money and ran down the block
came back and said y'all take a look at this rock
jane was gettin' into somethin' heavy that night
hurry up quick somebody give me a light
[name] said hold it he was pullin too fast
but jane was amused by the smoke in the glass
she was tickled to death at the faces they made
puttin' fire to the glass don't you think it won't break?
in a flick of a flash the torch was lit
she put it to her mouth and she took a hit
smoke rushed from her lungs and up to her brain
this was the beginning of the end of jane

jane stop this crazy thing [x2]

jane got weak and the bass got strong
what she used to do right jane now does wrong
i walked past one day called my man jack
she almost broke her neck 'cause she thought i said crack
it had to be a week since i seen her that day
but the body that she had just wasted away
when she used to walk by we used to say she looked chill
but now as she passes everybody go ill
the girlie we saw hop off mercedes benz
she was on it so hard she started stealin from friends
to all the drug dealers she was so in debt
that she sold her vcr and her tv set
jane used to live the life as the storybook tells
now everything she gets she eventually sells
sneak around the corner when you see jane comin'
she'll be touchin on your clothes the girl be crumbin

jane stop this crazy thing [x2]

if you know a girl who was the quiet type
who acts kinda funny and a bit too hype
these kinda actions only mean one thing
she's only buggin like that 'cause she's suckin the thing
not only the girls it can happen to guys
but the fellas try to beat you then they greet you with lies
one day jane coulda been my honey
i just couldn't wait till the girl made 20
i see her nowadays and all i do is sing
jane stop this crazy thing

jane stop this crazy thing [x3]

variations of jane repeated till end",1

it will never be repeated so listen well
and if you been around the way some of you might know
this girl we label as the project ho

project ho variations on the phrase

if you looked half decent and you kicked it right
she was bound to be yours for at least a night
see i was introduced to her by my cous'
but that was before he told me who or what she was
me not knowin' about this freak
pulled her off to the side and began to speak
she had jet-black hair big brown eyes
she seemed to be smart conversation-wise
i said you look so good as a matter of fact
here's my number i ain't home baby call me back
i didn't know if she was poor or filthy rich
cause my cousin didn't tell me nothin' 'bout the bitch
one thing i did know i'm gonna get my thrill'
then i cold stepped off and said baby you chill
you know that old saying 'if you're slow you'll blow'
she was fast so they labelled her the project ho

i heard stories on the things that they said she'd do
but when i seen her i said 'nah it can't be true'
she was fair game so i thought i'd play
and never in my life will i forget this day
i was chillin' one night i was all alone
noddin off but awaken by the ring of the phone
to protect the guilty party 'cause they mighta been stemmed
we won't say her name so we'll just say kim
what i heard her goosepimples ran up my skin
i said how how you're doin' and how have you been?
she said i'm doin' fine i hope you're doin' the same
do you know who i am? yeah i remember your name
i thought deep down that i peeped the card
kept sayin' to myself she was on it hard
i tried to be nice tried to treat her kind
but she had only one thing on her mind
it always happens well wouldn't you know
she said i see you later 'cause i got to go
my cousin came home and said are you some fool?
being seen in the streets with a gardening tool
i loooked up at him 'cause i did not know
he said kim that skeezer she's the project ho

me myself thought homie was dissin
despite all that i did not listen
wouldn't you believe it she called me again
and this was the line that i kicked then
i love to see you girl and i don't know why
don't try to play post cause you know you're fly
so i'd like to come and see you if i may
i was surprised as you when she said okay
now that that part was over and done
baby what do you do at times to have fun?
depending on the weather and the mood that day
sip dom perrignon at a broadway play
the other things are not good to mention
like comin' to my crib and relieve my tension
i told her i was in love from the day we met
after talkin' for hours kim said bet
i had to let her go just to clear my line
so i see you on friday let's say about 9
from the things she said why didn't i know
the girl on my line was the project ho

i took her out - fine's how it went
but i better got somethin' for the dough i spent
turned on the radio and heard a world premiere
turned to her and said where we go from here?
the best part of it all that thing that made it so treach
the clothes we wore were the same as the stretch
i recognized the look that was on her face
and i yelled to the driver homeboy my place
we made it there in at least a half
i got a choice of wines and a jaccuzzi bath
you'll scream when i tell you what homegirl said
show me to the room with the king-sized bed
i was rested real well so i felt strong
i knocked those boots that whole night long
right after she left i started to itch
then i thought of what happened then i said that bitch
i went to see the doctor later on that day
'cause when somethin' is wrong jack i don't play
the doctor came over this is what he said
you can't cure it with soup or layin up in your bed
you're lucky that you came to see me early my man
'cause i guess that you know that you got it shan
i said well my man that only goes to show
believe 'em when they tell you she's the project ho",1

otherwise known as mean teen tom
a brother whose known for his rap
jabby jack larry laughter and least not last
a cool brother by the name of gas
these brothers made you get loose
they was down with a brother called cousin bruce
they used to jam in the center
you had to pay so you could enter
go to the door
get frisked
just in order to get in
and if you wasn't from this town
then you couldn't fight and win
but every time they had a jam
they couldn't get no peace
so that's why the jam's out there
and the parks they had to cease cause you was in

by stupid little things put inside your head

devastating to your ear

rhyming is a thing that i do at will
be glad to rock a party just to prove my skill
j-u-ice is what i'm gaining
with a style so fresh that it's self-explaining
never bite a rhyme i don't live that way
but when i get dissed violators pay
i'm a crowd motivator mc annihilator
never front the move 'cause i'm not a perpetrator
i don't really mind bein criticized
but those who try to make fame on my name - die
rhymes of all styles all categories
from fresh freestyles to real fly stories
this jam is dedicated to you and your boys
and if you knew what i knew then you'd kill that noise

devastating to your ear

i devastate the crowd while the record spins
so call competators have no wins
i laugh at mc's who call me wack
you ordered and now i'm gonna serve you jack
we're respected by all treated just like kings
how could you have the nerve to say such things?
if you knew at the time what you were saying
you wouldn't be on your knees - praying
you gotta understand i'm not the average mc
at the first sign of trouble grab the mic and flee
grab the mic plug in the beat box jacks
prepare for the battle then proceed to wax
takes much time i feel is ample
to deafen an mc to make an example
this goes for all sucker mc chumps
who hear my name and suddenly kool-aid pumps
so if you're thinkin' 'bout dissin me better think twice
cause next time brother i won't be so nice
you can come all alone or bring all your boys
but if you knew what i knew then you'd kill that noise

to get up on stage and pop so much junk
i'm not worried 'cause i don't get waxed
and you wouldn't believe how hard i max
school's in session i'm about to teach
versatile with a style that you just can't reach
lesson number one first strike aim
you shouldn't do things to degrade my name
your records won't sell cause the people won't buy em
a sucker mc's like chicken - i fry him
i started with a smash i'ma leave with a bang
and to put it to you bluntly - mc's can't hang
your boys and your family will be grieving your death
weeping while they're sweeping up the pieces i left
you can come all alone or bring all your boys

being driven around in the freshest cars
all his beats and my rhymes are chill
now i'm back once again ready to get ill
the beat's not fake the rhyme's hardcore
my name is mc shan and i'm down by law

there's been this rumor going around
about low life crab saying i ain't down
but all mc's will feel my wrath
the system is my power the mic is my staff
i have the power of command the power of lust
at the battles all papers read

marley mixes 'another one bites the dust'

all across the country i know i'm hated
not only by crews i've devastated
don't ask how i know i just can tell
by the tone of your voice as you wish me well
filled with so much envy that your face turns green
cause my name rings bells on the hip-hop scene
so pull out a bottle let the champagne pour
fly rhymes so that makes me down by law

creeping across the nation like a midnight storm
always rock a jam every time i perfrom
records i make are not distorted
made in new york and not imported
have never been known to make an error
crews see me coming their heart full of terror
dip out the back when i step on the scene
watch the back door you'll see what i mean
i love to rock a party every time i can
my dj is marley marl and i'm mc shan
we make the freshest jams that you've ever heard
marl ain't we down? word

now that we've come to the very end
his beats my rhymes are a perfect blend
we are the ones all others admire
to be like us is their desire
never get angry always stay calm
yet do as much damage as a nuclear bomb
do or say anything we may
we destroy all objects in our way
as expensive as diamonds as precious as pearls
rap so strong take all y'all girls
make cold cash money make much much more
my name is mc shan and i'm down by law",1

he passed it to me i said no him said why?
my boy jumped up and said i'll give it a try
&gtfrom the very first time he ignited the flame
my homeboy wasn't actin' insane
i tapped him on the shoulder and i said let's go
he looked at me and replied with no
i said fuck it and left him there
the torch the pipe the base the chair
i came back five days from then
to my surprise i seen my friend
to let you know what this thing does

verse 1 mc shan
where i come from we never heard of bite
we can write the freshest rhymes at the speed of light
all my planet we're the real mccoy
and it's you earth mc's that i wish to destroy
when i rhyme i'm never out of place
i take you on a voyage to outer space
every rap i make you know it always sells
i fly the galaxy wearin laser cazels
i can fly from place to place quicker than you can snap
i'm known as the space wizard of rap
depend on how i feel if it's only for fun
i take my mic off of 'kill' and i set it to 'stun'
sometimes my rhymes do inflict pain
sends electrical impulses through your brain
in your earthling ears my rhymes are caught
transmitted to your brain is what's known as thought
i can see the devastation as i look in your face
listen to how the deejays rock up in space

verse 2 mc shan
to call yourself mc are you out of your mind?
you have to have a golden voice similar to mine
but when you have a jam that is cold set
you play the same old records one right after the next
for you to win the battle earth will have no chance
with the spinning of two records and you call that advanced?
to do that on my planet you'd be taking a risk
because the beats we play out live and that's not on a disc
the first time that they see it they might be amazed
and say why should we commit ourselves to permanent waste?
that's why it is impossible for us to lose
plug in the microchip of any beat that we choose
one thing where earth and my people might match
that is the similarity and sound of the scratch
we have stamina and also have poise
the only difference is our scratch is no sonic noise
to take earth mc's out is what i wish to achieve
once this is accomplished i be destined to leave
when i leave they'll call me an ace
that cool mc from outer space

verse 3 mc shan
although my color just might be green
i'm the flyest space mc that you ever seen
it might be in your future cause it can't be your past
but the reign of earth mc's don't have too long to last
all you fresh mc's you should feel ashamed
the wack around the world you put 'em down with the game
they get on the mic and be coppin a plead
about how good they rock on the m-i-c
on my planet you must take a test
i'm at the top of my class because i'm the best
i use my rhyming skills for what it is worth
that's why i'm here to battle all mc's of earth
if you take me out which ain't been done before
you might just start a interplanetary war
the war won't be to kill john and steven
the whole point of it is to get even
the war's to get even i will say indeed
and i will come back every year till the day i succeed
i hope i didn't stand here and offend you too much
if you ever wanna battle then get in touch
so i can come back and dis your face
pick up the telephone and dial mc space",1

there is no implication hip-hop is wrong
beats tapped out played back in songs
consider hip-hop as a verbal sport
it brings pleasure while expressin one frame of thought
those that don't like it then you're psychotic
to my point of view hip-hop has got it
rhymes being written every time you blink
with no vital signs of becoming extinct
try to demolish it will not be worth
killing all hip-hop fans on earth
don't try to compare it there's no relative
the word to describe hip-hop creative
once you're at a party you're in hip-hop's lair
to downgrade all how could one dare?
once upon a time they used to play soul
&gtfrom there they went to rock 'n' roll
rock died down then along came pop
now you're livin' in the world of hip-hop

i am the creator of my hip-hop style
with a level of college understood by child
hip-hop is being moved on a one-way course
up and being led by an unseen force
you try to hold it down won't be no good
the more it gets exposed the more it gets understood
it's all fantasy yet all realistic
often complicated other times simplistic
lyrics so sharp they can cut like a knife
i'm sworn by oath to the hip-hop life
less live drums less guitar strumming
hip-hop is the life of the up and coming
not by force by want and choice
persuaded by the beat and the mc voice
there are people who love it across the land
and there are those that think that it should be banned
well i say i love it it comes from my heart
very thankful for the day that it got its start
now that it got started you see it won't stop
and you'll be livin' in the world of hip-hop

is take away my pen and my hip-hop pad
take that away i have nothing left
so let it go free or sentence me to death
i know you had troubles with your moms and dad
when you were growin' up goin' through your childhood bad
some parents think that hip-hop means
wearin fat shoe laces and name brand jeans
it really doesn't matter just what you say
hip-hop will be around till you're old and grey
they're just all lies created by nerds
you think that i'm playin' you mark my words
just like man sends rockets to mars
hip-hop living is ascending to stars
the more it gets accepted you'll see it won't drop
and you'll be livin' in the world of hip-hop

runnin' neck to neck in the music world race
you don't have to listen if it isn't your taste
it's becoming worldwide internationally known
have you ever heard the saying 'to each his own'?
people like jazz cause that's their taste
i prefer crisp highs with an earthquake bass
there are hip-hop songs that make you tense
and then there are those not worth 2 cents
but still hip-hop's gonna make its mark
cause you used to only hear it in your neighborhood park
to all non-believers you should know your name
since the parks don't you see how far the hip-hop came?
it's been around for years and you ask yourself how?
for the very same reason that you're listening now
you might have been hooked from the very first line
cause raps like these cultivate one's mind
one day your resistance level might drop
and you'll admit it's a world of hip-hop

'cause i'm graphic on the mic i never let go
light skinner eat dinner like a soul man
prove with the rhyme i'm down sam's hands
transform strong too strong as a good pitch
switch up the wizdom into word which
kicks out the benzi in a frenzy it sends me
up the bronx river back to brooklyn apprehends me
like a d-tech bustin' my man in the projects
i'll send you up north i ain't givin' respect

see-ya echoes

some singing

yo yo that's ridiculous echoes",1
11,"all right coming up now another request this one
this time from the boys down at anna's pizza paradise
a new arrangement of a great oldie in rhythm and blues

in the heart of the city you was born and bred
you grew up smart or you wound up dead
things moved fast but you knew the scoop
and your savior was a rhyme and a beat and a rap group
a modern day production of the city street
you said i didn't have it that i couldn't compete
so the sleeper did sleep but the sleeper shoulda woke up
now you're in my sight the buddha sess you smoke up
that's the element you carry your rhymes on
that style of rhyme won't let you live long
cause a strong song to you is what i sent
'cause i'm a product of the environment

there it is black and white
there it is black and white

on the streets of far rockaway queens
seagram boulevard b-17
redfern houses where no mc would ever go
is where i did my very first show
had the crowd had the rhymes going i never fess
his reward was almost a bullet in his chest
and on that stage is where i first learned
stick out my chest to be a kid and get burned
you're so foolish but i think you knew this
that on the the microphone punk i can do this
and doing this is what life meant
'cause i'm a product of the environment

there it is black and white
there it is black and white

back in the days when kids were mack daddies
striped lee jeans playboys and caddies
long beach the mok center
he almost caught a bad one when he tried to enter our way
bang
bum rush the back door
then scatter onto the dance floor
me and my boys skeezin the cuties
never had static 'cause everybody knew me
local dj's tearin up the wax
and out the corner some kid gets taxed
after the party crack open a forty
vicked it from the store yo the man never caught me
went up to the arcade cranked the bass
and then the five-oh chased us from the place
hop on the railroad play the conductor
everywhere i went i always tucked a
marker in my jacket to tag where i went
'cause we were just products of the environment

there it is black and white
there it is black and white

i wanna tell you something that gets me kind of mad
it's about my dear old dad
he's tired and worn and works a nine to five
clockin thirty g's a year to survive
but i know kids who in a month or so
make that money sellin ya-yo
pushin a drug i can't understand
destroyin a life with a buck in the hand
play rotten slum chain local street hero
but if you ask serch you're just a bunch of zeroes
too bad 'cause when you're older you won't have a cent
'cause you're a product of the environment

there it is black and white
there it is black and white

you hear it in the strength of my voice and in my rhythm
now you know how i was livin'
it happened to me like it happened to serch
prime minister pete nice'll kick the verse
in bed-stuy with my boy kiwai height
the k to a kingston wednesday night
to the empire show slammin'
open for dana crew flammin
mouth open wide or listening
dumb dope with a forty in my system
unprotected but respected for my own self
cause of talent no shade or nothin' else
a time of tension racially fenced in
i came off and all the brothers blessed him
i left more than a mark i left a dent
'cause i'm a product of the environment

aiyyo serch skin is just a color of the mind and the soul
and a brother ain't a brother if his heart is cold youknwhati'msayin fellas?
word
and i think we need a positive kause in a much damaged society
word up man nubians killin' nubians brothers just don't understand
word maybe it's some of that crime that's stoppin' the growin'
the drug pollution and all needs to calm down
word man cause that's what we need we need griff productions
we need a kmd man to uplift the race and bring kause in the beginning
and a posse called get yours
there it is to all y'all bigots who want us to bend
we're just products of the environment peace
hopefully
there it is black and white",1

of where your mind is
the kind of stuff that you want to smoke blunts with

snapshots get the crack hot
good to get it but don't sweat it
'cause if you pursue she'll chalk the cue
and boom stroke the 8 ball
stick and run and were having fun
prickin my cactus like i'm shooting my gun
quickly till it explodes and i unload
the cactus

i stand for lust of quenchin
g sit on cactus and rotate
enough time to clock a digit
ass so large it won't quit
so i step to kick to
the oval office in my intro
throwin' low bass to the third line
a girl on mines a prop
so i found loops to hold
and then a boomin butt to go
to go lo solo readily
it's the cactus behind door 3

the smart villain chillin' like gilligan
out on an island
fishin with my string and bamboo
caught somethin' in a see through nighty
might be a little tasty a 300 pound white girl
no on to see this boom i dropped my fluid like a chemist
she's contained and i'm a lame brain
but doing the wild thing
kicked the fat thing off of my swing
larger than jim backus it's the cactus

no boots your money spent
last call for toxicants
one move to reach a throttle
eyesight is through a goggle
i trips to the hype type
good looking in the dark light
it's appetizing to conversate
to a fossil pushing 58
all bags and her butt sags
in the desert no price tag
a household tool and a stank ho

daddy rich scratches brooklyn

verse one mc serch

real cool cause brooklyn's cool
friday doin' the last day of school
girls steppin to the mall to swing
settin up dollars for their summer fling
cars on the avenue create gridlock
and there's girls like mad at the bus stop
not waitin on the bus but waitin on the cash flow
fellas are laughin' gassin the past hoe
girl steps to me and pushes issue
that knot you got is that money or tissue?
feelin' on the bulge thinkin' it's her own
i tell her that it's money and she should move on
she says she's pure from legs to her thighs
and we should talk over some chinese and fries
i tell her to step but hey that's the scene
'cause she ain't nothin' but a brooklyn queen

chorus repeat 2x

we are looking for 'brooklyn'
we are looking for the brooklyn-queens

verse two pete nice

state the rhyme borough of brooklyn
otherwise known as crooklyn
freaks fortify flesh with gold
ears hang trunk in a slave hold
walk past don't get the time of day
played like suede on a summer sway
conversated till i made her laugh
said i'm pete nice you want my autograph?
oval office closed as she heard this
she said from 3rd bass? i could do this
listen closely slowly took a swig of intoxicants
cause the brooklyn queen's a gold digger


verse three mc serch

squared away with my digits and tonight's plans
when i feel a crab grab my right hand
slapped her on the back tried to calm her
asking her now what's the reason for the drama?
her next move was straight out of textbook
haven't we met before? giving me a sex look
yo wisdom your lyrics are in bad taste
so i'm forced to give you nothing but the gas face
you better go for hoppin on the cab or bus
'cause you're downtown and you're simply too fabulous
but get this ain't this a humdinger?
she stepped to a retard sportin a four-finger ring
somewhere in the skin tight jeans
i'm gonna scoop the best of the brooklyn-queens


verse four pete nice

last exit to brooklyn i enter
carefully the queen holds my scepter
gettin' numb like a derelict on scotch
i'm dick lewis cause baby i'm watchin you
scheme on a brother for a knot
to choose between the have and the have-not
do you doubt the shade of vanilla?
i'll play elvis and you play priscilla
oh he's no hero better yet billy dee

loungin strength in my throat
sweatin as you get hit with the rhythm
my lines sustain like a crane so uplift them
slow and smooth flowin like fluid
the mass did worship the lyrics the three did
amid all crisis drop it like a guillotine
you're moist fearing the voice of the rhyme fiend
scene is zipped pete nice is your worst dream
fulfilled your illed i thrilled i heard a loud scream
my mind is cued so i run down a menu
that downgrades the weak as my lyrics tend to
the needs of a shaker sweatin to the point of exhaust
so listen to the mission horse
blinded by the science my mind starts flexin
sexin down females to the am perplexin
a complex reflex you wonder if we slumber
the three don't sleep aiyyo pete nice take 'em under

0,"now i have a story that i'd like to tell
about this guy you all know him he had me scared as hell
he comes to me at night after i crawl into bed
he's burnt up like a weenie and his name is fred
he wears the same hat and sweater every single day
and even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway
he's gone when i'm awake but he shows up when i'm asleep
i can't believe that there's a nightmare - on my street

it was a saturday evening if i remember it right
and we had just gotten back off tour last night
so the gang and i thought that it would be groovy
if we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movies
i got angie jeff got tina
ready rock got some girl i'd never seen in my life
that was all right because the lady was chill
then we dipped to the theater set to ill
we saw elm street and man it was def
and everything seemed all right when we left
but when i got home and laid down to sleep
that began the nightmare but on my street

it was burnin' in my room like an oven
my bed soaked with sweat and man i was buggin'
i checked the clock and it stopped at 1230
it had melted it was so darn hot and i was thirsty
i went downstairs to grab some juice or a coke
flipped the tv off and then i almost choked
when i heard this awful voice comin' from behind
it said you turned off david letterman now you must die
man i ain't even wait to see who it was
broke outside my drawers and screamed so long cuz
got halfway up the block i calmed down and stopped screamin'
then thought oh i get it i must be dreamin'
i strolled back home with a grin on my grill
i figured since this is a dream i might as well get ill
i walked in the house the big bad fresh prince
but freddy killed all that noise real quick
he grabbed me by my neck and said here's what we'll do
we gotta lotta work here me and you
the souls of your friends you and i will claim
you've got the body and i've got the brain
i said yo fred i think you've got me all wrong
i ain't partners with nobody with nails that long
look i'll be honest man this team won't work
the girls won't be on you fred your face is all burnt
i patted him on the shoulder said thanks for stopping by
then i opened up the door and said take care guy
he got mad drew back his arm and slashed my shirt
i laughed at first then thought hold up that hurt
it wasn't a dream man this guy was for real
i said freddy uh pal there's been an awful mistake here
no further words and then i darted upstairs
crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
pulled the covers up over my head
and said oh please do somethin' with fred
he jumped on my bed went through the covers with his claws
tried to get me but my alarm went off
and then silence it was a whole new day
i thought huh i wasn't scared of him anyway
until i noticed those rips in my sheets
and that was proof that there had been a nightmare on my street

oh man i gotta call jeff i gotta call jeff
come on come on
come on jeff answer
come on man
hello?
jeff this is prince man
jeff wake up
jeff wake up
what do you want?
jeff wake up man

what's up y'all hello how are you doin' out there
you're chillin' i'm winnin'
oh by the way the album's out go get it

we went to the studio and then we made a video
we didn't make a movie though maybe the next year or so
yo i got a message for my fans and friends
the last album was def y'all and here we go again

no applause no applause thank you thank you
we're back again and we're plannin on rockin' you
ten times harder than any other crew can
jeff is like conan i'm like tarzan
in other words wherever we go
haha we're runnin' the show but no seriously
it's been a while since we dropped one
but it's out now go buy the album
if you bought the last one you know it was krush
but if you didn't man you must not
know what you're missin' friend
the last album was dope y'all and here we go again

a lot of people may not have bought the last album
but yo jeff straight up we can't allow them to go out like that our music is too def
we produce hit records right and left
daytime night time def beat def rhyme
chorus line bass drum snare drum bassline
all of this makes our records rock till the party's end
here we go again

when we first came out we had a smash hit song
then people started askin what's takin' so long for y'all to put another record out for the airwaves
i said hold up let me explain when you hear a record on your radio station
it's probably getting played all throughout the nation
but we got lucky ours was played in germany
france japan sweden london italy
so therefore we had to go on tour
city after city encore encore bravo bravo
sorry we gotta go
we got another show tomorrow night in rio
the point i'm tryin' to make is to let you all know
it takes a long time to travel the globe
but now we gotta start this whole process all over again
the last album was def and here we go again

special thanks to everyone that helped us
without you we would not have been able to sell as many records we went top ten
and god willin' we'll do it again
it was a long hard road believe me
people tryin' to steal from me and deceive me
but that's cool you live and learn my friends
we did it before and we'll do it again",1

[fresh prince] it's new it's out of the ordinary
it's rather extraordinary
so yo bust this commentary
a literary genius and a superior beat creator
have come together and we made a
musical composition which we think is a remedy
to cure all the dance floors that's empty
you wanna dance? we got what you want
jazzy jeff and fresh prince bustin' out with the brand new funk

-get down brand new funk-hit it

it was kind of an accident the way that it happened
one day i was rappin' and on the beat jeff was backin me up
and all of a sudden he brought in a cut and i dropped my microphone and said
what the? hold up jeff wait a minute play it
he just smiled and said yeah def ain't it?
it was {funky} it made wanna {get get down} and we knew almost at once it was
the {brand new funk}
so we continued to listen to it
and we knew it was def when i started rappin' to it
so i gave a hi-five to jeff and without hesitation popped in my cassette
i took it home that night and analyzed it
rewound the tape over and over and memorized it
that friday we went to the club and out and out cold tore it up
you shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin' and spinnin
and clappin while the beatboxin was groovin and screamin and yellin' while on
the microphone i was flowin
fresh rhymes i was showin the people say yo keep goin so i continued to
rock while jeff was on the beatbox special assistance from my homeboy ready
rock
people barged just to get up front to get a bird's eye view of what we call the
brand new funk
ge-ge-get down-hit it

yo jeff {rock the beat} yo jeff {rock the beat} yo jeff {rock the beat} 
jazzy jeff cuts and scratches  yo jeff {rock the beat} yo jeff {rock the
beat} yo jeff {rock the beat with your hands}

jazzy jeff cuts and scratches  now get funky with the beat
jeff starts spinning backwards  now turn it all around
the most original amazing astounding miraculous remarkable startling
sensational stupendous music
that has ever been created is ours - but believe me it was complicated
but we have done it so now we can breathe a long awaited sigh of relief
this isn't a publicity stunt it's the raw untouched pure hard brand new funk

3,"for years i have been waiting and hesitating to make a rap record
that had the pace of a slow song quiet storm chillin' while the fire is warm
you and your girl with this record on your radio or stereo i don't know
i love you so is what you'll be sayin' while this record's playin'
you reminiscing and kissin' your girl
relax lay back unwind cause now is time to chill

setting the mood by the use of this groove
is an ingenious perceptive brilliant a very clever move
because the bassline combined with the fresh rhyme at a slow tempo enticed passion to grow
but if it's not passion for which you search then use the song as a massage after a hard day's work
and if it's true that music calms the savage beast
play this cut in the jungle and put the lions to sleep
take a deep breath stretch kick off your footwear
put on the tape of this record but beware
caution warning it's your decision
there's nothin' stronger that you can buy without prescription
it's soothing somewhat hypnotic
a rhythmic anaesthetic it's practically a narcotic
you want it we got it come get it we're widdit
because it's all at the push of a button yo jeff hit it

the objective of this musical extravaganza is to enlighten you stanza by stanza
verse after verse have been precisely arranged
rearranged and then changed until the best remained
the result being this incredible song
so for at least eight hours a day you'll have this record on
in the morning and at night in your room
and it's all through the afternoon you will be listening mentally rapped up in the cut
some people will sit down and some will choose to get up
but whatever you choose just keep your ear to the wax
because we got something def that other rappers lack
we haven't been able to put our fingers on what it is
but it's different and it's def and it appeals to kids and teens and adults and senior citizens too
and i'd be willing to bet that it appeals to you too
so if you're not into rap give us a chance to change your mind and to make you dance
to this lyrical miracle this musical discovery
but yo i wanna chill for a second yo jeff cover me

it's like paradise this music is nice
it makes you hot if you want it too or twice as cold as ice
it brings love to the heart of a criminal
with this subliminal power all the women'll flock while all the guys rocks when it's on your box
it gained us a much bigger reputation than the white sox
you may ask yourself are we that famous
bust this the queen of spain knows what my real name is
our time is runnin' short so i'll bid you farewell
you know this cut is so def that you have been overwhelmed
be cool be chill relax have no fear
i'm outta here",1
5,"as we go a little somethin' like this hit it

now let's get this party started off the right way
ow and ho i think the crowd might say
when we're on stage you know you can't resist
as we go a little somethin' like this hit it
i'm the ultimate and that's all i can say
i sat down for about eight hours a day
tryin' to figure out the proper description of me
and i came to the decision that there's no one syllable or phrase
that can adequately describe this new craze
but i'll sum it up in one sentence let's see
okay i've got it all praise me
yup that's about the size of it
i know it sounds kinda strange doesn't it
but when we're on the stage you know you can't resist
as we go a little somethin' like this hit it

as we go a little somethin' like this hit it

it was a friday afternoon if i remember it correctly
but i can't quite recall the time exactly
but it was somewhere around two or three or four
oh forget it let's just go on
anyway i stepped out of school
sneaks were gucci shirt was polo and my pockets were full
blew some kisses to the girlies 'cause i like to tease
they started chantin my name i said ladies please
i grabbed my friends and hopped in my benz
grabbed on martini and rossi passed out to my posse
things were lookin' good i had plans for later on
plans for donna michelle plans for stacy leshaun
word i was ready i wonder if jeff's home
let me give him a call on my car phone
yo jeff what's shakin coolin whassup
girlies i'm with it come pick me up
i caught up with ready on the way to jeff's
a whole carload of girlies and they all was def
we walked into jeff's and said girls you can't resist
as we go a little somethin' like this hit it

{jazzy jeff cuts and scratches slick rick
as we go a little somethin' like this hit it}

yo jeff man are you with me hit it
i didn't hear you man are you with me hit it
i'm with it to get busy

somethin' like this hit it

ready rock c give jeff a hand

as we go a little somethin' like this hit it

throw away them jams cause you don't need 'em any more
cause this hip-hop hit is gonna keep you on the floor
if you dance everyday or if you never danced before
it doesn't matter if it's somethin' like this
time is essential so let's make the best of it
today we don't have a lot of time so let's not throw it all away
let's use this time in a very special way
let's use it somethin' like this
i went outside at about 1230
i saw a couple girlies and they were lookin' pretty good if you know what i mean
so i freshened my breath and stepped on the scene hit it
i walked over to em stepped in between them
one said to the other i think that i've seen him somewhere before
i said sweetheart you might have
she said oh yeah it was last night at that party
i said yeah i tried to talk to you there but you were acting as if you were scared
she said i'm not scared now i said bet well let's go then
she said but hold up what about my friend
i said i got a friend
so the three of us left
went back to my crib and gave a call to jeff
five minutes later jeff walked in
and i thought to myself yeah now the fun begins
but the girls started buggin and they said
now we want dinner in the best restaurant in town
we want caviar and lobster tails both by candlelight and don perignon i said yeah right
y'all must be crazy and jeff said you know
i really think it's time for these ladies to go
we walked 'em to the door and told 'em they were dismissed and it went a little somethin' like this
but that was okay that was all right
'cause we still had fun that night ya know it
the moral of the story is plain and visible
we always watch out for those kind of women
but the past is the past and the present is the present
and we feel that everyone should be sitting down
so you all don't miss
as we go a little somethin' like this hit it",1
6,"you know parents are the same no matter time nor place
they don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes
so to you all the kids all across the land
there's no need to argue parents just don't understand

i remember one year
my mom took me school shopping
it was me my brother my mom oh my pop and my little sister
all hopped in the car
we headed downtown to the gallery mall
my mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
i didn't say nothing at first
i just turned up my nose
she said what's wrong? this shirt cost $20
i said mom this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar
the next half hour was the same old thing
my mother buying me clothes from 1963
and then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
i asked her for adidas and she bought me zips
i said mom what are you doing you're ruining my rep
she said you're only sixteen you don't have a rep yet
i said mom let's put these clothes back please
she said no you go to school to learn not for a fashion show
i said this isn't sha na na come on mom i'm not bowzer
mom please put back the bell-bottom brady bunch trousers
but if you don't want to i can live with that but
you gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks
she wasn't moved - everything stayed the same
inevitably the first day of school came
i thought i could get over i tried to play sick
but my mom said no no way uh-uh forget it
there was nothing i could do i tried to relax
i got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
and when i walked into school it was just as i thought
the kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes mom bought
and those who weren't laughing still had a ball
because they were pointing and whispering
as i walked down the hall
i got home and told my mom how my day went
she said if they were laughing you don't need them
'cause they're not good friends
for the next six hours i tried to explain to my mom
that i was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
so to you all the kids all across the land
there's no need to argue
parents just don't understand

oh-kay here's the situation
my parents went away on a week's vacation and
they left the keys to the brand new porsche
would they mind?
umm well of course not
i'll just take it for a little spin
and maybe show it off to a couple of friends
i'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
well maybe i shouldn't
yeah of course i should
pay attention here's the thick of the plot
i pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
that's when i saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
i picked up my car phone to perpetrate like i was talking
you should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
i honked my horn just to get her attention
she said was that for me?
i said yeah
she said why?
i said come on and take a ride with a helluva guy
she said how do i know you're not sick?
you could be some deranged lunatic
i said c'mon toots - my name is the prince =
beside would a lunatic have a porsche like this?
she agreed and we were on our way
she was looking very good and so was i i must say - word
we hit mcdonald's pulled into the drive
we ordered two big macs and two large fries with cokes
she kicked her shoes off onto the floor
she said drive fast speed turns me on
she put her hand on my knee i put my foot on the gas
we almost got whiplash i took off so fast
the sun roof was open the music was high
and this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
she had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
i guess that's why i didn't notice that police car
we're doing ninety in my mom's new porsche
and to make this long story short - short
when the cop pulled me over i was scared as hell
i said i don't have a license but i drive very well officer
i almost had a heart attack that day
come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
i was arrested the car was impounded
there was no way for me to avoid being grounded
my parents had to come off from vacation to get me
i'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
my parents walked in
i got my grip i said ah mom dad how was your trip?
they didn't speak - i said i want to plead my case
but my father just shoved me in the car by my face
that was a hard ride home i don't know how i survived
they took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving
i can't believe it i just made a mistake
well parents are the same no matter time nor place
so to you all the kids all across the land
take it from me parents just don't understand",1
7,"in the place to be
dj jazzy jeff and yours truly the fresh prince
ay jeff do me a favor give 'em just a lil touch of the bass
not a lot just a lil' touch jeff
word word
ay jeff do me a favor man jazz it up
now bring it all back

yo man now break it down and let me go for mine

when i first started out jeff used to come to my house
just as soon as school let out he used to come to my crib and you know what we did
we bugged out like two little kids word
jeff on the wheels and me on the m-i-c
a better combination there could never be
so let's go back for old time's sake
yo jeff what pump up the bass

i like my music loud
the volume pumpin the kick drum thumpin
the people jumpin' up out there seats when this record comes on you think something's wrong
the bass is too strong
you don't have to check your record it's not defective
it's just the way we wanted it pump it get it
we like it loud strong like a magnum force
i am the lyricist jeff is the rhythm source
this combination is virtually omnipotent
that means invincible you know dominant
so don't you cross our path just stay out our face
or we'll knock you down or pump up the bass

yo jeff man how 'bout a funky scratch
now get funky with it
now bring in the snare
now break it down and bring it all back to me
now pump up the bass

i'm hyped psyched up and i'm flowing so come on let's go in to the next segment of this hip-hop fantasy
you say this can't be happening why can't it be
it's an equation mathematically correct
it's jeff plus prince equals hit records
sounds too easy word i know it does
you wanna know why well yo it's cause me and jeff oh jeff and i excuse me
blend like kool-aid and flow like an uzi
that's why we can't be taken or broken or braken whatever
and if you think we can you're mistaken we're clever
cause all we did to make this record a hit
was turn down the treble pump up the bass kit
at the same time the volume was increased
adding more strength to this masterpiece
of poetry by now you know it's me
poet creativity pushin to out destiny
i am on the m-i-c jeffery is the disc jockey
and to keep us company the human beat box ready c
backed up by a family and that is all we need
so that we can be successful as we want to be

red is the rose's color blue is the violet's
here's my number baby when you get home dial it up
i'll be your man and you can be my lady and you can come to my house and we can get busy baby

girl forget about your boyfriend he's nothin' but a hassle
you can come with me and cold chill in my castle
oh what a wonderful time it would be imagine you and me in my jacuzzi
or horseback riding or we can play tennis
but the most intimate part will be when it's time to eat dinner we'll go get dressed
and then we'll give a call to antoin my private chef
first we'll eat crab legs by candlelight
then sip wine by the fire for the rest of the night
and if the time is right i'll ask you to be my lady and we can dip right upstairs and get busy baby

you know since i first met you
i wanted to let you know how i felt so i could get you to treat me like a phone and take me off hold
and make your hero come so i can pour my heart and soul
i can't help but dream about the ultimate life
two kids a dog a goldfish and you as my wife
we'd have a rosebush with a white picket fence
and all the neighbourhood kids would call me mr prince
and on the lazy saturday afternoons
right after me and the kids get finished watching cartoons
we could send them both outside to go playin'
and we could spend some time upstairs get what i'm sayin'
the only problem that we would have is whether or not to drive the porsche the benz or the jag
and every night before bed flip the radio on and sip dom perignon to the quiet storm
gucci louis vuitton you want more
gloria vanderbilt or liz claiborne or christian dior from head to foot
the world is yours if you'll be my toots
oh i know what your problem is
look those other chicks are just good friends
i'll give up my harem if you'll be my lady

pretty smile light brown eyes
i've got miles on them other guys face it

but let's discuss it perhaps over lunch about how i'll be your poopsie and you will be my hunnybunch
now isn't that special
why ain't you widdit?
you'll be my only girl yeah that's the ticket
life's a risky business babe you know the deal
sometimes you just gotta say what the hell
now is that time roll for the money
life is a gamble but i'm a sure thing honey
girl you know you driving me crazy
so how 'bout it come on let's get busy baby",1

ready rock
hey man hold up man
i think i wanna tell 'em a little about this man
aight break it down ready break it down

please pay attention to my rhymes so i can tell you all about this pal of mine
he's my buddy my best friend
when it's a beat i need it's a beat he'll lend
i wanna take time-out to talk about him
cause frankly i don't know what i would do without him
we work together like a medical crew
when i'm backin ready up i'm backin prince up too
tryin' to beat us that doesn't make any sense
he's ready rock c and i'm the fresh prince
in the rap industry we're ranked at first
ain't a better combination in the whole universe
so if you wanna battle your future looks muddy
that you just can't beat my buddy

word break it down break it down ready

we've won so many battles people think it's a trick
that when the crowd gets to judge it's us that they'll pick
they see ready's face and then they hear my voice
to choose us as the winners is the natural choice
because battle after battle we remain on top
'cause it's not the way we look it's the way that we rock
so if you thought you wanted to battle bust this rhyme
just keep it and i'm sure that i can change your mind
there was ten wack dudes trying to play high post
one crew got bold and they began to boast
but said y'all shut up and get back in line
but they refused what happened now so now there's nine
nine wack crews tryin' to rock like this
they were bitin my rhymes and just couldn't resist
i said please stop bitin please don't imitate
but they kept on bitin so there's now there's eight
eight wack crews poppin' big time trash
telling us that in a battle we can't last
the battle started at 1030 and by quarter of eleven was no longer eight crews how many was their
there was seven
seven wack cruise in a football huddle
trying to figure out their next rebuttal
they came out strong you'd think their the ultimate but we just dissed 'em and dismissed so now there's six
six wack groups tryin' to be tough
who the hell told 'em they could rock the mic like us
we got straight down the business didn't pop no jive
we just blew 'em out so now there's five
five wack crews lined up in the hallway
all perpetrating like they're read to play
my secretary walked out she asked for one more
they got scared and left so now there's four
four wack crews outside playing around
i said i'll take you wall on now how does that sound?
not one had heart enough to pick up that mic
i said okay i'll let you go psych
that's the moral of this story
never try to take me and ready rock's glory
'cause if you do your future looks muddy
cause you just can't beat me and my buddy

haha word uh
yeah ready rock hold up hold up hold up
wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute
what man what?
c'mon man man i wonder can can i just interrupt the record for a second?",1
16,"ever since i was younger i was into video games

oh no i feel an attach coming on
yo ready rock c i wanna play a game of donkey kong

it used to be a problem this addiction i have
i would feel the urge then i'd go stark raving mad
break into the arcade screaming and hollering
anticipating putting twenty-five dollars in any machine i was out of control
i didn't need quarters i brought $10 bank rolls
bags of quarters i was insane
people thought that i worked there and asked me for change
but i would get defensive and yell leave me alone
these are my quarters stupid go get your own
dude walked away with this look in his eyes like
yo man i wonder what's wrong with that guy
i was addicted a video burn-out and i would crazy when the guy would have to turn out
the lights at midnight i'd fall on my knees and say
have a heart pal one more game please
some nights i might sleep on the subway or outside of the arcade till it opened up the next day
and when it opened at a quarter to ten it was the same old thing all over again
i was doin' bad my future was bleek
i'd rather play games than eat or sleep until one day this guy came along
he didn't have a radio but he was playin' a song
i got curious so i said yo what's that noise? what noise? i don't know
no fool that noise you was makin' there what this
yeah
that was def man where'd you learn to do that
man i don't know i guess i always knew that i had this talent deep down inside
you wanna hear some more man yeah come on let's take a ride
he made sounds like i never heard before and he still had more
then he got me hyped when he played this incredible song and i lost my mind when ready c played donkey kong

yo ready get funky with it

i get hyped up no matter how bored i am he always comes through

the music started in the hearts and drums from another land
played for everyone by sons of the motherland
sendin out a message of peace to everybody and
came across the oceans in chains and shame
easing the pain and it was without name
until some men in new orleans on rampart street
put out the sounds and then they gave it a beat
i'm talkin' bout jelly roll king and satch
i'm talkin' 'bout the music that had no match
yes the music and it was born down there
we're gonna use it so make the horn sound clear
it's jazz music jazz music

yo the music that pops and other cats made
it stayed cause people love when they played
to the north it took a riverboat shuffle
to the big cities with lots of hustle and bustle
to chicago and to the apple too
this was a scene that our forefathers knew
go get your crew i know they'll get into
the jazz music jazz music

the music called jazz had the razzamatazz
it had the flavor and a lot of pizazz
the big band beat was very neat and unique
the swing was king it made you tap your feet
there was benny and duke and of course the count basie
the melody was smooth and yes very taste
there was hap the prez and lady day and
dizzy bird and miles they were all playin'
they brought it to the people of the foreign lands
back across the oceans and the desert sands
where it echoes in the distant sounds of drums
and it rises with the sun on days begun
this is the music that we give tribute to
they gave it to us that's why we give it to you

look back into your past brother
look back into your past sister
look back into your past sister
look back into your past brother

afrika
my forefather was a king
he wore fat gold chains and fat ruby rings
nobody believes this to be true
maybe it's because my eyes ain't blue
you ain't gonna find it in your history book
come here young blood and take a look
dig down deep inside this hard cover
don't you know you was bought brother
all you read about is slavery
never about the black man's bravery
you look at the pictures and all they show is
afrikan people with bones in their noses
that ain't true that's a lie
you didn't get that from my lemon pie

mike g
yeah i cut class i got a d
cause history meant nothing to me
except a definite nap
that's why i always sat in the back
i'd talk to girls or write a rhyme
'cause i didn't know all times are black man's times
when i was young my mama told me stories
of black peoples' fight to bring us glory
i used to think these were stories to put me to sleep
but now i know mama's talk wasn't cheap
i know afrika's for afrikans
and history's the blood of every woman and man

now i begin another search the incredibly involved
the incredibly difficult and incredibly frustrating search
trying to pull together the history of a people

afrika
page one page two page three
and still no signs of me
yeah so i looked into the table of contents
they wrote a little thing about us in the projects
only history we make is if we kill somebody
rape somebody but other than that we're nobody
speaking like a brother living in the jungle
i know i was here first but i remain humble

mike g
now it's time to rekindle the fire
a tribe of young brothers with the eye of the tiger

afrika
acknowledge your own we have a home
put on this earth to live and roam

mike g
christopher chose to explore
discovered america yeah sure

afrika
he thought the planet was square
travelled many places we already had been there
we left tracks backtrack back
first civilisation you know where that was found at
looking for the true black days of glory
that's history that's his story

ah pleasant day in egypt i say
say what is this?

afrika
a tisket a tasket
i wonder what's in that basket
sweet daddy strolled by and said haven't you seen here?
that right there is belly dancin dina
now i'm all junglistcally horny
desperate to see this fine young lady
toot toot toot pulled out my flute
yeah she was so cute
i said i like the way you move around
do you wanna get down?
i wanted to take her home with me
behind the bush and up my tree
so i blowed and blowed and i kept on blowing
hey wait a minute baby where you going?

mike g
dina never should have seen her
hooked by her look now i feel like i need her
body so pure she's shaped like an hourglass
as i turned around i peeped out her megablast
i needed acquaintance 'cause i had no patience
drugged by her bellybutton? no by her radiance
the hips did dips so i did flips
the pucker of her lips could sink battleships
the basket's glowing from the diamonds' glitter
if i only had it in me to go get with her
the moment i got it i needed a casket
'cause she blew me a kiss and jumped back in the basket

belly dancin dina
boy you should have seen her
the way she moved her body
all across the dance floor
tore me all apart straight to my heart
and it was nothing but a freaky art

kool dj red alert
live from 113th street and seventh avenue
straight out the pyramid we gon bring to you
the live one they call belly dancin dina

afrika
well today's the day hooray hooray
yippee yie yo yippee yie yie yay
everybody's waiting for her to arrive
ooh she makes my nature rise
all dressed up in her sparkling clothing
i might pass out when that basket opens
ordinarily i'm not the kind who fiends
could it be her cute little finger tambourines?
i don't know but it's making me hard
how hard? harder by the yard
thousands of brothers had congregated
stone boom waited and waited
they came in peace they paid their funds

kool dj red alert
ok y'all here she comes

mike g
i've got to go get her word?
and if you got bananas i'll be glad to betcha
push back my chair to walk across the floor
as i got closer her body shook more
my eyes were set on her jelly-like belly
and if i'm dreaming don't nobody tell me
people started standing i started losing sight
and i was really feeling like this was my night
i dipped to one side and then to another
ah i see dina ooh my brother
i made a quick to dash to put my hands on
poof dina was gone

afrika
and when she disappeared to no one knows
all she left behind were her silky clothes
smelled the smell of her sweet perfume
heard a voice say i'll be back real soon
say say where you going?

belly dancin dina
boy you should have seen her
the way she moved her body
all across the dance floor
tore me all apart straight to my heart
and it was nothing but a freaky art",1

you can't change what's meant to be
you can't hit what you can't see
it's easier for a camel to walk through
the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to enter the gates of heaven
treble bass haste makes waste
nature puts things in the right place
hot baked carrot cake
in life there's many things at stake
roads places avenues streets
i'll walk a mile for a funk-e beat
i put these words in a special order
because i was overcome by the forces of nature",1
9,"backed by the baby bam beat the rare groove
jungle bros no competition and nothin' to prove
want me to be on your family tree
but you're all about yourself which won't
allow me to be
you see i'm the kind of brother that gets up
on the stage
to get down for the people that came and paid
i throw on my uniform but not to get pretty
show no shame feel no pity
you all showed up and i'm glad you came
still the same person everything's the same
once again i show towards you all due respect
but my main concern for now is keepin' things
in check
hands in the air and everybody will sing
as they hang on the my rhythm like the
beeds on my string

recess

my soul sings a funk-e song as the beat
goes on and on
another day gone and still learnin' my right
from wrong
the party's gettin' packed as i turn up the
bass more
the meter's goin' crazy up and down like a
see saw
takin' off my crown to give my lo lo lo locks
a breathe
i wanna stop myself but i still got some
rhyme left
uncle sam breaks it down as everybody
shakes the butt
brothers gettin' happy lettin' out the longin' nutt
hands in the air and everybody will sing
as they cling on the rhythm like the beeds
on my string

recess

you know what
sisters on the side sayin' get on get on
brothers everywhere sayin' jump on it
can't get enough of what i'm doin' here
well the picture is painted the message is clear
here the beeds are the people the string
is the vibe
the vibe is what mentally connects the tribe
once you get on it you can't get off it
you fall off beat well baby doll you lost it
maybe next week of even the next beat
makes ya feel at home beats up against ya dome
find ya self inside an afrikan syndrome
found ya culture brother i told ya
black is beautiful money is powerful
you was afraid that's why you stayed away
the true blue brothers they followed me anyway
i gave 'em alternative found a new way ta {sic} live
somethin' that's positive which i thought was
good to give
a whole lot of tribes of us feelin' the vibes
from us
everybody's down nobody's ridin' us
hands in the air and everybody will sing
as they hang on to my rhythm like the beeds
on my string

now everybody pump your first as we proceed
to leave this place
step into a zone where there's no mind for
color face
children are the future so let them lead the way
carry our nation into a brighter and better day
evil will be broken by allah in due time
we will soon find out what is matter and
what is mind
now hands in the air and together we sing
as we the pretty colors of the beeds on
the string",1
10,"all are present and accounted for
take roll call there's a 100 or more
brothers sisters that i call my tribe
livin' a high on a funk-e vibe
step in the stride and all think the same
play differently but all the same game
i don't eat meat 'cause i'm not that mean
drink a lot of juice so my insides are clean
do unto others like they do to us
stay out of the grip of in god we trust
work by day ritual by night
the vibe holds the tribe and it keeps it real tight
we give each other weight instead of sayin' hi
and that's the first feelin' when you feel the
tribe vibes

recess

the sun set moon rised stars shined
i knew it was time
tribes got together you heard the jingle jangle
jingle jangle comin' from all angles
i heard the bongos
bongo beats from the jungle
a ritual a ritual a ritual
fire in the middle i chant a little riddle
i saw a man on the side takin' pictures
but some of us never paid him no mind
click click flash flash boom-bash
smashed up his camera weakened his stamina
we didn't kill'em we painted him black
put him down wit the tribe put'em down wit
the pack
took his gun and took his rifle
changed his clothes and told'em to sit still
he tried to run but there was nowhere to hide
so at the end he gave in 'cause he felt the
tribes vibes

bridge to the vibe gatherin'

a bird must fly but soon he lands
good and bad both clap the same hands
open doors mean open minds
and these 2 things mean change of times
i watch my back so i'm never held back
i keep in mind that black is black
the u-funk keeps me goin' under
and fills the mind to make it wonder
come on in and feel at home
but do not take what is not your own
a man once took and never returned
and it's shame he had to learn
an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
prophet moses as he speaks the truth
you can run but you never can hide
so hope the tribe stays on your side
a group of people a tribe of people
join together for one cause
sellin' you and tellin' you
get up and go for yours
tribe vibes is a level of consciousness
tribe vibes you got to get into this
we all are thinkin' on the same plateau
a tribe kalled quest to de la soul
tribe vibes is a level of consciousness
tribe vibes you got to look into this

funk we transmit is unstable
one condition if i am able to say
yes you may well hey let's get on with it

sister monie the only one here who missed a plane back to london
residing with my brothers and i learned a lot from them
about the group how to be smooth and play funky
and sometimes rated it's kind of funky but it's cool
for we are beyond the stereotypes
coordination crazy but still it sounds hype
rocking on and off beat and i do believe i'm right you're right
am i wrong? yeah son
don't be mad be glad i missed the plane i'm staying
with the brothers jungle soul and the tribe i'm saying

from soul to soul large to lose ends
? and i all my groups like kill?

reasons for this is that the family's strong

and once you're inside spread yourself around
from the bottom to the top the top to the bottom
come on master dee get funky while we got em

three minutes left

me and my partner from the start
we usually get together after dark
sometimes to rap sometimes to sing
in the summer or the winter 'cause it ain't no thing
and ever since i first came round
side by side we'd throw down
we came here to this here place
to serve you all right to your face
because this jam here is our show stopper
we didn't wanna do it but i guess we gotta
we're the men of the hour makin' the ladies scream and holler
to hot to trot to sweet to be sour

and i hope that it is not too late
if you want the best i won't settle for less
put your money on me i'm your best bet
come on
one for the treble
two for the bass
three for the ladies
four for the plaid
five minutes of funk this ain't no junk

from the bottom to the top the top to the bottom
i'm gonna rock em while i still got em
our rappin' shower has style and power
and this is our disco hour
i don't know what all of you have heard
so it's up to me to spread the word
about the man that we feel has got to be real
our crowned prince on the wheels of steel
he goes by the name of grandmaster dee
so if it's all right with you it's all right with me
we gonna rock you people's minds with ease
with some help from the maestro if you please

right before the fun was about to begin
crowds of people lined up inside and out
just one reason to rock the house
but in the day time the streets was clear
you couldn't find a good freak anywhere 'cause

now when freaks get dressed to go out at night
they like to wear leather jackets chains and spikes
they wear rips and zippers all in their shirts
real tight pants and fresh mini skirts
all kinds of colors runnin' through their hair
and you could just about find a freak anywhere
but then again you could know someone all their life
but might not know they're a freak unless you see them at night 'cause

and when the crowd's like this i'm ready to rap
but before i could bust a rhyme on the mic
freaks are all over me like white on rice
freaks come in all shapes sizes and colors
but what i like about 'em most is that they're real good lovers
they do it in the park they do it in the dark
but most freaks are known for breakin' hearts
you could never tell what a freak was thinkin' of
and you may never catch a freak without at least one glove
they don't walk when they step they strut
nine times outta ten they drive you nuts
so take my advice you don't stand a chance
freaks are so bad they got their own dance
so if you wanna live a nice quiet life
do yourself a favor don't come out at night 'cause

from the bottom to the top the top to the bottom
come on master dee get funky while we got 'em

three minutes left

me and my partner from the start
we usually get together after dark
sometimes to rap sometimes to sing
in the summer or the winter 'cause it ain't no thing

and ever since i first came 'round
side by side we'd throw down
we came here to this here place
to serve you all right to your face

because this jam here is our show stopper
we didn't wanna do it but i guess we gotta
we're the men of the hour
making the ladies scream and holler

to hot to trot to sweet to be sour
i'm gonna set the record straight
and i hope that it is not too late
if you want the best i won't settle for less

put your money on me i'm your best bet
come on one for the treble two for the bass
three for the ladies four for the plaid

five minutes of funk this ain't no junk
so pull your bottom off the tree stump
ladies real pretty from city to city
but now we're getting down to the nitty gritty

from the bottom to the top the top to the bottom
i'm gonna rock 'em while i still got 'em
our rapping shower has style and power
and this is our disco hour

i don't know what all of you have heard
so it's up to me to spread the word
about the man that we feel has got to be real
our crowned prince on the wheels of steel

he goes by the name of grandmaster dee
so if it's alright with you it's alright with me
we gonna rock you people's minds with ease
with some help from the maestro if you please

one minute left

i'm sorry your five minutes are up
please begin your ending
or your volume will be terminated",1
3,"a big mouth a big mouth

there's a rumor bein' spread about me and the crew
about somethin' we did or supposed to do
you might not have heard it or maybe you have
but when i first heard it all i did was laugh
i used to get angry and all uptight
but you could say what you want just spell my name right
'cause all i'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house
but that's not what the rumor was all about
now if you're like yvette tell all your friends
and if you don't wait until you see me again
this way i could hear it from the horses mouth
and right then and there we could straighten it out
because i don't get involved with he said she said
so take my advice and quit while you're ahead
because one day i might not laugh
the day your mouth writes the check your behind can't cash

you got a big mouth a big mouth
you got a big mouth a big mouth
a big mouth

people used to say that you had a big mouth
and now i understand what they're talkin' about
because what we do is just between me and you
not somethin' that you run and tell your crew
but you had to tell sharon and she told carol
then the story rode on just like a wheel barrel
carol told dee dee and she told pam
and pam was overheard talkin' to her man
pam was told cookie what she thought she heard
and somehow eazy e had got the word
he told somebody i knew from uptown
and they called me up and put me down
now the whole darn story's been changed around
and that's the reason why i'm not with you now
because you never shoulda opened your mouth at all
and i wouldn't have no reason to make this call

you got a big mouth a big mouth
you got a big mouth a big mouth
a big mouth

now you're the don dapper of the neighborhood
and every time i see you you're up to no good
you're just like a snake crawlin' on the ground
lookin' for some new dirt to spread around
then you stick out your tongue and start spreadin' lies
and now somebody else has been victimized
you may stop for a while then you're at it again
and you always got to have the last word in
they call your mouth almighty tongue everlastin'
you ain't satisfied unless somethin's happenin'
you don't have to be there no more than a minute
but you always got to have your two cents in it
so to all you big mouths this jam's for you
some'in' else you could run and go tell your crew
'cause we made to be big so we could rock the house
but we also made it big enough to fit in your mouth

you got a big mouth a big mouth
you got a big mouth a big mouth
a big mouth

you got a big mouth a big mouth
you got a big mouth a big mouth
a big mouth",1

i need a break gotta get away
i left my house this morning on my way to work
some lady on the train spilled coffee on my shirt
and people started laughing like the whole thing was funny
i woulda went home except i need the money
cause times is hard my boss is crazy the guy that works with me he's so damn lazy
sits around all day drinks coffee and tea he expects all the work to be done by me
and sometimes i wonder what they hired me for to operate computers or run to the store
and when i ask for a raise they tell me be patient i've been working three years without a damn vacation
things could be better but they're gettin' worse until i got this job i never used to curse
well i've had it up to here with people treating me wrong so why not tell the dj to play my song

escape gotta get away
i need a break gotta get away

i buy a lottery ticket every chance i get
and if i hit i got someplace my boss can kiss
my friends are backstabbing so i hang out alone
think it's crazy on my job it's no better at home
my girl's half-mad she drives me wild
all she ever cares about is rippin' the styles
she wants diamonds furs and now she wants kids
but what she needs is somewhere else to live
my psychiatrist tells me to give her more time but one more second might blow my mind
the pressure's building up on me more and more it's gotten so i'm doing things i've never done before
i need a break y'all i can't take this place i feel locked up and i wanna escape and i wanna escape and i wanna escape escape escape escape escape escape escape escape

so you wanna leave your job but you need the funds
take a sick day off and find another one
and if your girl or your man ain't treatin' you right
just the same but your headaches night after night
don't go crazy trying to please somebody else you don't owe them a thing but you owe it yourself
so do what you gotta in order to escape
take it from me it's never too late
'cause i'm breaking these chains i may never come back
going to go out and give myself a rap attack
and if i like it a lot i'm going to make it a double
and if you stand in my way you're looking for trouble
there's only one way for me to have peace
and that's for me to go out and rock the beat ha
so turn it up the highs boost up the bass come on everybody let's rock the place

gotta get away
escape gotta get away
i need a break
gotta get away
escape gotta get away

friends

is a word we use everyday
most the time we use it in the wrong way
now you can look the word up again and again
but the dictionary doesn't know the meaning of friends

and if you ask me you know i couldn't be much help
because a friend is somebody you judge for yourself
some are okay and they treat you real cool
but some mistake kindness for bein' a fool

we like to be with some because they're funny
others come around when they need some money
some you grew up with around the way
and you're still real close too this very day

homeboys through the summer winter spring and fall
and then there's some we wish we never knew at all
and this list goes on again and again
but these are the people that we call friends

when we first went out together we barely knew each other
we had no intentions on becoming lovers
but in no time at all you became my girl
me and you one on one against the world
talkin' on the telephone for hours at a time
or else i was at your house or you was at mine
then came the arguments and all kinds of problems
besides making love we had nothing in common
it couldn't last long because it started out strong
but i guess we went about the whole thing wrong
'cause out of nowhere it just came to an end
because we became lovers before we were friends

friends
how many of us have them?
friends
ones we can depend on
friends
how many of us have them?
friends
before we go any further let's be 
friends

you say you and your girlfriend were so tight
you took her out with you and your guy one night
she even had a set of keys to your home
and you shared mostly everything you owned

but as she shook your hand she stole your man
and it was done so swift it had to be a plan
couldn't trust her with cheese let alone your keys
with friends like that you don't need enemies

you wonder how long it was all going on
and you're still not sure if your man is gone
you say well if she took him he was never mine
but deep inside you know that's just another lie

and now you're kinda cold to the people you meet
'cause of something that was done to you by some creep
but nevertheless i'll say it again
that these are the people that we call friends

we've got a style of our own on the microphone
and when it comes to rocking we stand alone
i'm the rapper jalil and i'm ready to rock
and once i get started i'm hard to stop
i've got the magical touch to make you shake your butt

so i'll say some here and say some there

hotter than fire too young to retire
with the special gift to take it one step higher
peaches and cream the american dream
protected and respected on the disco scene
climbing that ladder we're taking the crown
cause you just can't keep a good man down
we deserve the part from the very start

0,"yo aladdin make sure my microphone is on
no wait a minute - hm-hm now let me check my tone
before i start rockin yo what we're callin this homes?
ain't nothin' goin' on word
well if it ain't nothin' but a funky song i'm in it to win it
properly fitted so let's get with it
my lyrical format breaks and bends the rules
for those of you who wanna battle my crew
i come from the family down with priority
peace to nwa and eazy-e
and to the homies everywhere that's down with low pro
y'all want funk? yo yo now here we go
can i come on or should i come off smooth and dope?
spectacular to make a amateur choke
you see it's gotta be funky doper than the average funk song
that's why i didn't come off strong
i chose a laid back jack and watched the others swoop and holler
they try to kick funk but yo why did they bother
this is pure funk so y'all sing along
ain't nothin' goin' on but a funky song

funk - the word for the day that i speak upon
it's like a drug you could say that i'm sprung
every time that i speak i pertain to a funky crowd
turn up the radio make sure that it's loud
the woofers are bumpin the tweeders and tweetin the bass is kickin'
doub's about to start the rippin'
all these mc's sound alike screamin off of funky tracks
got the nerve to put the garbage on wax
artificial mc's i break 'em with ease they get dunked
they all lack the true meanin' of funk
a street hardcore sample with a positive tip
this here is so funky all i need is a mothership
a pair of twelves and a mic in my hand see
so i can get busy for those down with me
have you yellin' my name while i pertain to the brain
'cause when it comes to funk i'm leavin' permanent stains
so change arrange and yo i ain't a new jack gee
aladdin gave me the mic so i could speak my piece
funk the universal language now can you swing it?
some tried but came softer than a danish
dunkenhein rappers is soft they can't compete
now here's a dope record tooken out of the backstreets
y'all know the words so yo sing along
ain't nothin' goin' on but a funky song

so now we come to the final verse of the song
i came to short-circuit so go and clap along
wave your hands in the air while you shout and go off
but keep away from the stage because you might get tossed
yo now here's somethin' that i know that you like
somethin' funky but yet though it's gotta be hype
so sing along even though when i'm gone
ain't nothin' goin' on
peace
but a funky song",1
1,"i'ma take this opportunity to explain
why would a kid in '89 wanna sling cocaine
kilos of cracks in stacks and spend 20s and 10s
and at the age of 11 own a brand-new benz
but i don't blame it on the kids man the system is wack
there's more money on the streets gee than flippin over' big macs
but if you're still confused just groove to the music
'cause i'ma show you why they do it

that's why they do it

call up the press the newscast 'cause i'm about to serve
a dope message segment yeah that need to be heard
why would a young'un comin' up wanna sling in the streets
instead of plannin' for an educated college degree?
here's an answer who's a role model in the ghetto
while these young 'uns live in the slums like bums?
they ain't got a role model so they look up to the brothers on daytons
while daddy drive a station wagon
slackin' lackin held in the back and
mama's broke as hell so they start sellin crack and
clockin more g's than the jackson 5
see to them slingin drugs is a way to survive
go get a job minimum wage no don't even bother
slavin like a sucker for 385 an hour?
nope i ain't with it y'all can take that back jack
and stuff it down your mouth like a garbage can compact
'just say no' - man these children are laughin' slingin dope
yo the slogan's a joke
people keep speakin' 'pon drugs but they never coincide
when they never slung dope in their life
how can they speak upon a subject at which they lack knowledge?
you say you're tryin' to stop drugs? it's all a bunch of garbage
but if you're still confused yo just groove to the music
'cause i'ma show you why they do it

that's why they do it

now if you're still havin' trouble tryin' to find a reason kids sling dope
and sport a fat gold rope
let's take a look at this materialistic system bro
specifically designed to keep minorites broke
you know the news got me laughin' every day they comin' up with somethin' new
curfews and task force crews
but who's to blame because they never ever seem to work
it just seem that more people get jerked and hurt
how can they account for the problem which they started?
hey yo you must be retarded
but if you're still confused just groove to the music
and doub'll show you why they do it

that's why they do it

no more lollygaggin wastin' time let's get to the facts
you ask what could spark a kid into slingin that crack?
then think about it to a kid comin' up in this surrounding
the cash and caine he's more than forced to sling
his homies used to do it and his brothers do it too
so he gotta do it or else he ain't cool
suckers try to knock him but they never succeed
so much money his pockets parents down to his knees
almost blamin on the parents the first thing we do
in '89 y'all a kid's gonna do what he wanna do
but what do you expect when a brother lack role models?
all he know is women cash and eight bottles
most people make it to the top man they never come back
speak to the kids say yo this is wack
too busy havin' fun in the next man's game
they think they made it but they got a shackle still on they brain
people try to play me like a booty-neck sucker
the system sling but see they do it undercover
you want the truth well here i just threw it
peace - that's why they do it

that's why they do it",1
2,"now here we go y'all gotta play this
why? cause the others are so scared to say this
now tell me what am i supposed to do
about a sucker like you who ain't never paid dues?
slapper hip-happer you're gettin' wacker
your girl better step or i just might jack her
smack her like a gangster but i don't bang
i gank suckers like you for thick gold chains
he don't deserve it hell nah
so take it off your neck
cause goddamn you ain't comin' correct
what's this a sucker duck holdin' a mic?
like keith sweat said somethin' just ain't right
seems nowadays everybody wanna be a rapper down with crews
but they ain't never paid dues
suckers perpatratin playin' hardcore
punks i bet you worked at a flower store
you know what eats me up the most?
is when a sucker just started and thinks he's high post
you ain't pay a nann due in your life
talkin' 'bout a new style you know who you sound like?
krs chuck d kool moe as one
yellin' on the mic like the name was run
you'se a peon when i bought a pair of lee's
now all of a sudden you're supposed to be an mc?
yo that's wack it just ain't right
you only stood on one stage in your whole damn life
now you want respect hey yo you'se a fool
everybody wanna rap but they ain't paid dues

i can still remember way way back in the days
the times me and aladdin dreamed of gettin' paid
standin outside just pullin the jacks
to earn a little money to drop a dope track
back in the days i drove a raggedy dodge
couldn't afford a studio so we used a garage
aladdin used to grab a gang of disco breaks
one turntable and a broken 808
my little brother tunes and frank they hung around all night
to make sure that the demo was tight
didn't have an enigneer if you know what i mean
aladdin did it all at the age of 16
gifted uplifted i was mad as the mack
suckers had me playin' the back
but thanks to ice-t i got my foot in the door
now i'ma rock the mutha-uh till it ain't no more
we paid dues

i knew a brother who used to dress just like a faggot
real tight jeans some boots and leather jackets
homey as hell he never came outside
cause every time i came around he used to run and hide
spoiled like a brat had everything he wanted
and when he walked he switched like a woman
rode a pink bike man the sucker was soft
had to be in before the street lights came on
yo just the other day i turned my radio on
the _mack attack_ kicked on a brand new song
i didn't know what it was i never heard it before
but the record was smooth and hardcore
i said to myself 'hey yo i gotta see this group'
so i called up aladdin and the rest of the crew
grabbed the nine with the hollow point tip
stepped in the party with a gangster limp
took a look at the stage and yo what do you know?
the same old faggot from a long time ago
from real tight jeans and a go-go boot
he went to pendeltons and a khaki suit
now tell me ain't this a blip?
somebody need to slap the perpetrator in the lip
yesterday he was a mama boy now he's rappin'?
foolin the crowd because he got you all clappin
and tappin an example of what i'm tryin' to prove
a sucker like this who ain't never paid dues
to those who wanna rap i'm pertainin to you
before you pick up a mic you gotta pay dues

let the story be told
that's the way it is
you got to pay your dues

low profile definitely payin' the dues

frank my little brother crazy tunes jazzy d
we in there everypaid they dues

3,"funky

check 1-2 yo everybody what's up?
low pro is definitely in effect and bringin' y'all the dope stuff
this here is doper than dope it's rather potent
that's why they got me here cause see i don't believe in jokin
they're jokin and hopin i come out stroken
diss my crew? give me some of that you're smokin'
so many artist keep swearin they dope
they only good for one thing y'all that's droppin' the soap
so pay attention that a dope lyrical that's guaranteed to rock
funk creatin' this the rhymes on a spot
i reach ya like a book while i'm servin' ya
i must admit your chain is big though i never heard of ya
i'm into rockin' crowds back and forth and forth and back
so if you're lookin' for the funky material this is where it's at
so clap your hands and stomp your feet while i get loose
the doub is in effect and i'm releasin the juice
and demonstratin versatility rhymes come very easily
lyrics transformable with flexibility
i put a song together so quick it's funny
see to you it's a job but see to me it's easy money y'all

funky

it's like snatchin' candy from a baby but i'm not a candy-snatcher
you see it's simple to keep these rhymes comin' atcha
lyrics are flowin intensity's growin'
the crowd is gettin' hyper than hype people fillin up the floor'n
just to get a glance of the pro goin' solo
now hold on now wait a minute let me get my stroll on
so i can come off ill but still remain mellow
i prefer it this way yo with a nice slow tempo
this sort of rhymin requires patience
determination anticipation leads to aggravation
what i'm tryin' to say is that this whole thing is funny
to some it's a job but see to me it's easy money y'all

funky

this is easy money our money come in easy whatever's clever
turn up the lever cause the rhymes are gettin' better and better
so many rappers fallin' off that it's weak gee
they used to be dope but see it really doesn't pay to sleep
but slept rappers makin' it hard on theyself
they never practice therefore they're screwin everyone else
yo i write every day y'all ain't a damn thing funny
i wanna get paid cause this is easy money

funky",1

swift as wind slammin' harder than a domino
mc's surrender consider my attitude the bomb
toy or pro don't you know i'm from the pro
the intent of the jam's to let the rhymes flow
the name low pro will grow stronger over centuries
but when you say our name then don't forget to mention these
dope jams that kept suckers in check
yo you know low pro will keep flowin correct
to melodies like these eliminate mc's
pump the volume on the jvc
kick the bass but no too loud drainin the lyrics
i took my time with this rhyme so y'all can hear it
now dig it time to get busy low pro is on a uproar
jackin mc's between tours
just takin' what's mine i'm not a thug of any kind

i'd flow in the nile [sample from eric b &amp rakimmy melody]
keep flowin'

tired of all these rappers talkin' 'bout the same thing
who got the most money or the biggest gold chain
it's a shame i can't even turn my radio on
without hearin' some punk with a wack-out song
what it's a wack season? that's all i'm hearin' on the radio
punks are comin' softer than soft they're like clay-doh
but play the bank stable and able but for a rhyme that's fatal
you punks remind me of play-doh
cheap slapped together artificial material
you shitty-drawers rapper yo you're sweeter than cereal
you all sound alike tryin' to hang with the trend
but then again nowadays i think wack is in
i don't sweat it no more i used throw a tantrum
when i seen a wack record on the chart go platinum
but now i see it ain't who you know or who's deffer
it's all on who's behind you to support that record
comin' from the streets of la this ain't a joke
and in compton brothers gettin' smoked over dope
gangsters standin on the corner waitin to blast
on any sucker they see yo with the wrong color rag
that's why i'm recitin' this poem showin' and flowin'
yo we got to come together start growin' and growin'
despite the negativity this life has been goin'
put our minds to work and let the lyrics keep flowin'

so keep 'em flowin'
dj aladdin
i'd flow in the nile
keep flowin'

grab a pen take notes focus on the turntable
some call him dope but i call aladdin fatal
think he ain't sucker duck i think you better start walkin'
yo yo aladdin let your fingers do the talkin'

bite it

this ain't a mickey mouse theme you scheme you're bound to get beat chief
run up punk and walk away with no teeth
don't sleep on the w dope lyrics are mandatory
a young warrior designed to tell the real story
about the profile roll the carpet down the aisle
i'm steadily black on black and i be damned if i smile
or snuggle juggle pop a grin or even chuckle
step towards the doub and taste five rugged knuckles
so when i get to flowin yo it's nothin' but smooth sailin'
that's illin out plus steadily prevailin'
and swellin' on the top of the hip-hop list
yo yo take me for a joke a quick way to get dissed
boy the jack of all trades is like the ace of spades
aladdin cut the record like a brother with a blade
while the w recites on the mic all night
keep the party in check but suckers still try to bite
they get upset when they pop a cassette
and hear the profile bailin in deep deep effect
yo we make jams for just about everybody
to let you know this ain't nothin' but a party
with history messages stories i'm showin
througout eternity low pro will keep 'em flowin'

good god
the beat is dope
yup
word to the mother
and it goes a little somethin' like this

how ya livin' a brother kill another for a color
now his family's forced to sit and suffer
gang violence strikes again the sound of a trigger
news at 11 now it's one less nigger they figure
self-destruction bro you're goin' low
how can you kill a person you don't really even know?
in jail you played hard until one slapped you silly
turned you over like a girlie and rode you like a sissy
trapped behind bars in the middle of nowhere
doin' 10 to 20 braid another brother's hair
on the streets you was dope you wasn't a joke nobody could cope
you was the king of the dope
shoot a brother in a minute man that was your duty
but now you're in jail just givin' up the booty
spread em i'ma show you what it's like in a jail
i kick reality this ain't a crickett fairytale
you said you had heart homeboy how do you figure
can you prove it without keeping your finger on the trigger?
you'se a punk a peon a buster bound to run
never usin' your fist always grabbin a gun
trigger-happy with the gat brain stiffer than a manakin'
shot an old lady but you claim it was a accident?
drop the sawed-off you must be illin'
i got a question homes how ya livin'?

the beat is dope so i come off smooth no need to yell it
now what i seen on the streets i gotta tell it
smokers on the corner at the rock house shack
tryin' to scuffle up some money for a 10 piece crack
and this is critical pitiful life has become more difficult
children on the corner holdin' automatic pistols
taught and trained at a young age to kill another
but the bad thing about it is we're killin' each other
brothers killin' brothers over man-made material
it's a like a epidemic better yet venereal
only if you knew that we was dominant original
we'd be prepared mentally as well as physical
some say to make it though it's gonna take a miracle
but they can't hold you back brother when you're spirtitual
drop the 40 ounce you must be illin
yo aladdin break it down while i ask 'em how they're livin'

yo
let me tell you bout this crackhead i know

booby was a crackhead smokin' that dust
like a fool he was a sucker i never could trust
used to let him in my house he didn't need no permission
until my goddamn vcr came up missin'
sprung on the pipe like a fish on a hook
yo booby got labelled as a neighborhood crook
seen him with a color tv in his hand
walkin' down the streets sparked lookin' for the dopeman
skinny as hell from just hittin the pipe
lost his job his two kids the beautiful wife
he'd sell his mother if you gave him a chance
long as booby got a piece of crack in his hands
hey yo you know what's sad or should i say it's a shame?
the way c-r-a-c-k destroys the brain
think - somebody wanna see these things
another dumb brother just smokin' cocaine
suckin up crack until your lips turn purple
from rehab to rehab you're runnin' in a circle
it's mandatory i touch this category
that's why i made it simple self-explanatory
it shouldn't take long for me to state what's on my mind
why should i sit and write a 10-minute-long rhyme?
hey yo drop the 40 ounce you must be illin'
so i conclude this rhyme with how ya livin'?",1

concentration a method i use to allude
or confuse or remove a sucker away from my crew
no mercy i'm givin' no slack to those who wack
flinch an inch and get beat with a bat
now here's a mellow rhyme i slapped together a few minutes ago
pertainin to those who dissed the low pros
kept us on hold called us dead broke yo
you know punk i got the right to take your life on the go
'cause you'se a perpetrator you ain't down you're just around
and by you step off punk before you get beat down
brutally dissed not only mental but physical
brought face to face to the 5'10 lyrical
wc now it feels hey yo check it
when you mention my name think of a full metal jacket
not mislead i improvise and many buy it
but don't slip unless you wanna see a riot
smile in my face you're nothin' but a backstabber
roamin around sayin' that i'm a weak rapper
to solo artists and crews and those who never heard of me
i'm here to say that the w is givin' no mercy

he's got style
he's got grace
he's got humor
and he understands his format

verse 2 wc
picture flames steadily burnin in front of your dome
intensity is growin' and growin' the heat is gettin' strong
you're trapped inside have lost your breath
lookin' at death cause on the dub you slept
and overlooked the professional
but see i kept comin' yo
lyrics so fly that shoulda been on _that's incredible_
now why would a sucker wanna battle the dub?
you're just a featherweight or better yet a scrub
a snob i dedicate not perpetrate get it straight
to you '89 rappers y'all ain't all that great
want a l i meet your rhymes at the hip-hop shows
with styles that played out with gladys knight and the afros
you ain't down punk you're not invited
you're jokin my rhymes all you wanna do is bite it
correspondin to my rap the need to adapt
comprehending to my english i'm not talkin' in japanese
or chinese i'm speakin' of a disease
called 'perpetratin' you punk mc's
yo the w strikes like a sword just rippin and shrippin
you phoney rappers in half y'all be trippin'
like little women feminine punks you need to quit
i want the mic like a basehead want a hit
versatility ability makes it hard to step to me
step off you're soft go face humility
really see you wanna be jocks of impurity
step towards the dub - aw man that's stupidity
mentality gotta be growin' strong stop gaggin me
strategy seek destroy comp's a dead tragedy
rhyme designer i didn't climb to encline
here's some old school stuff y'all to mess with your mind
like poison or raid but too bad i don't spray no mo'
now i throw grenades and carry 44's
bro you're too slow hit the danceflo'
it's time for the w wax and tax shows
solo artists and crews and those of you who heard of me
i'm here to say that the w is givin' no mercy

i'm gonna let you know that i'm divine competition
when i give a show don't front just pay admission
to see the greatest rapper that will ever perform
cause this is a rap attack not a quiet storm
went downtown to meet my girl
light brown dimples and natural curls
got to her school what did i see?
some onionhead brother tryin' to talk to my g
i said i beg your pardon no need for alarm
but i am the man with finesse and charm
a man of good nature no quiver or qualm
didn't wanna have to do the boy no bodily harm
told him silvie is the girl that i came to pick up
and if he kept talkin' to her he'd be pressin his luck
he said i'm sorry smooth bee i didn't recognize
didn't recollect nor did i realize
that she was your girl but it's no surprise
'cause when it comes to cutiepies you win first prize
so i thanked for the compliment then stepped off
grabbed my girl and jumped in my ride and broke north
took her uptown so we could make love

smooth bee
i think i love her
but the lord only knows if she's the one for me
my true queen
i can't ask for more physical attraction
baby girl is real hype
she says she wants to bear my child
is it because i make hit records
or 'cause i'm a good lover?
i don't know i guess i'm a little petrol
together we do things that i've never done with anyone else
like eat ice cream together sharing chinese food
and of course entering each other endlessly
you see when i make love to my woman
i like to tear down walls and build new ones
i take her through multiple ecstasy
and this girlie insists that she's my match
my new love level
but i just can't front anymore
i can't feel it
so therefore i must carry on
just take me to love court
cause smooth bee's not settling down
call me a tramp jiggalo ho et cetera
but my jimmy's not for sale
more than one woman's my motto
i'll never be caught stranded with a flat tire and no spare word
yeah right
in four more months you'll be having our child
that's if you intend to have our child
and since we both made this commitment
which brings forth fruit through light
be like a strong tree with strong roots
and like a strong limb i'll never fall off
unless the sustainer of all living things allows it
and i want you to remember baby that i do love you
i really do

i'm sorry baby i'm so so sorry
i didn't mean to bruise your delicate flower-like emotions
listen - i was on some hardcore illusion of what love really is
you know i used to put up a phony forcefield shield
and the whole nine yards
keep my true feelings locked deep inside a box
but when your love was so strong so potent
it was too much for my heart at last
guess i was somewhat immature but i've grown up now
baby you gotta take me back i'm on the verge of self destruction
i never had a love like yours before
remember our walks through the park our cozy dinners for two?
our exhange of love juices? mmm-mmm
baby don't throw 'em all away
the only reason i broke like i did is because
i love - i mean i couldn't react any other way
just think - another man sleepin' in my bed
with the one i love? please tch
i'm just too nice for that
please baby take some time think about us you and i me and you
i'm sure you'll realize that i'm the one for you

hey yo kickin wicked rhymes like a fortune teller
had a dog by the name of old yeller
old yeller had a fiendish plot
schemed and dreamed for me to make a knot
ever since then booties clock me like big ben
as i go on and kick more
got more songs than a record store
some is sniffin and some is buffin
some is riffin some ain't sayin' nothin'
but my pockets i am stuffin
huffin puffin blow the house down
nice and smooth is in your town
i own a sailboat and this i quote
collect federal notes from songs i wrote
not the shah of iran and i'm not the pope
but my name is on the walk of fame like bob hope
baby doll bust the sketch don't forget
that i'm a trooper and you're troopette
i'm mr smurf and you're smurfette
i take you to the hotel
you take me to the motel
like a rocketship i will excel
when you do a crime you go to jail
pay the bail then hop the bail
bounty hunter is on yo' tail
mission to bring you back to jail
pump a little weight so i'm not frail
baby doll you know what i'm sayin'?

when i'm on the mic there won't be no delayin' [x3]

smooth b
smooth b - my rhymes express awareness
and i possess finesse and we share this
i'm at the top of the pile
my long rhymes span infinite miles
'cause i'm buildin a new rap level
through bass and treble i will abolish the devil
i must prevail
smooth b too fresh to be stale
i stay def beyond 2000
and my spirit will keep arousin
all new jack boys and girls
and i never had jheri curls
smooth b rollin' right and exact
and givin' no slack i'm tellin' you flat that
i am an orator dope rhyme conniseur
never leavin' you bored on the dancefloor
you want more smooth b's got enough for 4 scores
chewin mc's like reese's pieces
and treatin other mc's like feces
they walk around with no direction
they get mad over our complexion
they didn't pass inspection
nice and smooth is your resurrection
i'm like an audi with fuel injection
don't wear glasses got good perception
used to rock at the t-connection
and teddy ted got the scratch in section
you know what i'm sayin'",1

let's make it funky

verse 1 greg nice
hey yo
dizzy gillespie plays a sax
me myself i love to max
redbone booties i'm out to wax
stick up kids is out to tax
spring again and i'm feelin' fine
pass me an ice-cold glass of wine
so i can get mellow
lay back and let my girl play the cello
hello
i hate jell-o
let me be me relax in my tipi
watch a hardy boy mystery
greg n-i-c-e
i'm nitro
and i'm hype so
don't ever believe
that you can deceive me
see many visions of love and splendor
i'm the real thing not like a pretender
i rock rhymes over beats on the real tip
stay real strong and hang on like a vise grip
use my mind to control all my body parts
got an early start plus i'm very smart
type of man that the girls wanna read about
indeed i proceed to rock the house without a doubt
steppin up next no further ado
smooth b is gonna make it real funky for you

chorus pure blend
i'm gonna make it real funky for you

verse 2 smooth b
smooth b notorious glorious
knowledge is infinite i live in a fortress
i'm so astronomical yet on a physical plane
my body's just a shell in control is my brain
i strain to gain spirituality
so i can finally be in unity
harmony with the all eye-seeing
supreme being
knower of histories and mysteries
i'm mystic also stylistic
not materialistic simplistic
humble while others tumble stumble
smooth b not bumble
rumble no that's not likely
that's in my old 'school daze' like spike lee
smooth b my rhymes get better with time
i should get an endorsement for creating fresh lines
and as i grow older lyrics get hyper
'cause i'm a dominant black pied piper
spreadin peace and love throughout my travels
and take time to read and unravel
day to day problems and then solve
them i can see clearly now as i revolve
around suckers
who perpetrate heroes
but i'm no sandwich
more like a manwich
or maybe like a meal
which is much more real
than clark kent or the man of steel
teddy tedd a hip-hop ambassador
keepin' you on the floor givin' you more and more
his cuts exquisite what is it? a blizzard
the musical wizard you should come visit
the man in the back without further ado
teddy tedd is gonna make it real funky for you

i'm gonna make it real funky for you

let's make it funky

greg nice makes it funky
smooth b makes it funky

smooth bee

ah right about now i'm gonna reminisce
of how a fly mc became a rap-ologist
around the time when chubby checker invented the twist
i used to play spin the bottle run catch and kiss

i got a blue mercedes a big brass bed
i live on a hill overlookin a view
and i came here tonight just to rock for you
so let's a rock y'all and get dowwwn
let's take a trip on a funky merry-go-round
you see round and around and around we go
and when the funky beat stops everybody will know
cause there's a time and a place where we'll all have fun
and smooth bee will be your number one
master of ceremonies and you must admit
that i was born and raised to make top hits
so vicious malicious and very discrete
i have mystical powers i perform any fete
i'm gonna be ranked at the top of my field
i'm gonna see my name in the rappers guild
with all the other rappers who wanna be known
i'll be boastin with a gold-tone microphone
'cause i'm death-defyin never caught lyin'
not a female's love i'm ever caught buyin
get so much sex that i might explode
and on a sperm count scale i'm an overload

greg nice
yo i'm a trooper and i do loopers
i do stunts and i smoke blunts
forty ounce of private stizzinock

an entrepreneur undercover love
man of the world with my life to explore
minks socks leather suits shirts made of velour
smooth articulate entertainer mc
i'm rappin' to a funky beat my dialogue's unique
every time she sees me she offers me a skeeze
she says please smooth bee please please

i taunt and tease as she drops to her knees
and i let her wipe my nose every time that i sneeze

i met this girl at the french riviera

and let me kiss your lips and give you a - treat?
i said baby listen i'm not dissing

verse 2 greg nice
greg nice i met this dame
i like her style she feels the same
is she gaming merely claiming
to be my girl to change my world?
i don't like to be uptight
i don't wanna fuss i don't wanna fight
she's obsessive too possessive
i wish i knew this girl's objective
i met baby girl when i was on tour
gave me more than what i bargained for
makes me breakfast while in bed
she loves to keep her man well fed
diplomatic socialistic
baby girl had strawberry lipstick
it tastes sweet just like honey
said to myself yo this dip's a dummy
tried to gas me for my money

lookin' out beyond a level of sight and sound
to wear a crown might be profound
but pound for pound i must astound you
or leave a stain inside your membrane
i wanna reign supreme like a powerlord
and use my brain and a pen like a shield and a sword
since my mind conceive this why not believe it
my hands receive it and therefore i must achieve it
then i have no other alternative
than to show the party people just how i live
see i emerged from a level called brown
and like an atom radiates i develop from the elements
then i saw a vision of greatness
so i proceeded to follow a path where only warriors go
i found the glow i learned to know to go with the flow
i've grown but must continue to grow
i'm like the sun or should i say the north star
a black pearl or maybe i'm a quasar
i'm bright as hell sometimes it even scares me
how in the world could one mc be so deep?
i don't creep like a frog i leap
and i reap what i sew and sew what i reap
my lyrics seep into your soul and gain control
this is a fact not rigamarole
i'm icy cold but warm like a mink stole
see i've been writin rhymes since i was pre-natal
i have a lust and hunger for stage my attraction is fatal
if i was to categorize me
i'd be a bigger surprise than human eyes could see

teddy ted the late night rocker
gets a little tipsy when he drinks a little vodka
but his hands stay steady on the wheels of steel
you duck dj's y'all know the deal

teddy ted scratches the above lines and more",1
1,"have you ever in your life experienced a day
where nothing at all seems to go your way
no matter how hard you try to get out of the rut
you just could not break the string of bad luck
a day where murphy's law takes over your life
and you just can't seem to do a darn thing right
and when the day was over you just had to say
you said man it's just one of those days

my day started off kind of cool
i brushed my teeth i comed my hair and i got dressed and went to school
i stopped at the store for a breakfast snack
a tasty cake and orange juice and a bubble yum pack
about that point i proceeded to class
i spoke to all the pretty girls that i passed
i went to my room which was on the first floor
i had no idea what i was in for
i sat in my desk and minded my own business
someone knocked on the door the teacher said who is it
this girl walked in my imigination ran wild
she stole my heart just by the way that she smiled
i couldn't resist so i grabbed her butt
she said what's wrong with you fool are you some kind of nut
the teacher turned around while my arm was extended
she looked me in the face and said prince you're suspended
i said your tripping it's just a bad habit
she put it in my face she must've wanted me to grab it
i pleaded my case but she wrote the pink slip
then i just shoke my head i said i don't believe this
she sent me to the head of the discipline staff
i tried to play it off so i started to laugh
i said ha ha this story is great
it's a big misunderstanding one big mistake
he didn't think that it was funny he didn't even smile
he said mmm mmm mmm you're an unlucky child
i stopped laughing and i said why is that
he said just get out my school and don't you ever come back
i said wait this is my school and you're telling me to leave it
he handed me my books and said yep you'd best believe it
as i walked out the school back at the wall i did gaze
and said man it's just one of those days

i woke up around a quarter to eight
i wiped the sleep from out my eyes and i was feeling great
i flipped my radio on and to my utter surprise
i thought that it was eight o'clock but it was half past nine
i hopped up and put my feet on the floor
ran to the bathroom then i ow hit my foot on the door
the pain was immense as it started to throb
i said to hell with broken toes i was losing my job
so i combed my hair then i brushed my teeth
threw on my fila suit and my fila sneaks
threw on my fila underwear and my fila hat
then i ran downstairs and kicked the fila cat
i grabbed my jacket then i grabbed my keys
then i prayed out loud car start please
the car started but what good was that
i couldn't drive it anyway because the tires were flat
i did the hundred yard dash to the top of my block
then i grabbed a dollar bill from my left sweat sock
the bus pulled up i was late and kind of nervous
i got real mad because the sign said out of service
i started hiking it i wasn't liking it
i saw a little kid i stole his bike and started biking it
i thought i got away but when i ducked around the corner
there was twelve cop cars i said i'm a goner
slamed on the flat i did 180 turn
peddled the bike so fast i heard the rubble burn
with the cops in hot pursuit i started feeling like a jerk
i thought man all of this 'cause i was trying to get to work
i could've got away i almost had 'em shook
till this girl walked by something said not to look
but i thought what the heck a little peek can't hurt
but she made me miss the sign that said men at work
i screamed out loud as i crashed through the baracade
i saw my whole life flash before my face
i felt kind of dizzy all i saw was stars
i put my hands over my eyes and settled on the handle bars
that was stupid i got off track
cause about that point everything went black
the next thing i remember is a head ache nagging
i woke up face down in the back of a paddy wagon
i pinched myself to make sure i wasn't dead
a big flinstone lump on the side of my head
they took my picture and my finger prints
i said wait you can't arrest me i'm the fresh prince
i demand that you release me you incompetent fool
you can't arrest me i'm the prince you know the rules
you got five seconds 'fore i punch out your lights
but then the cop pulled out his gun i said ha ha psyche
i had a call so i called my boss
i figured i might as well what else could be lost
boss i'm sorry that i couldn't make it today
he said what are you talking about you're off today is saturday
stuck in a cell scared as hell
i'm a hungry kind of tired and i hate this awful smell
maybe one day i'll get smart and change my ways
but for now it's just one of those days

it's just one of those days",1
2,"when we rock the house there is no doubt is no doubt
that me and ready c will turn it out turn it out
we're down with the dj jazzy jeff jazzy jeff
and you know that we are def that we're def
and you should not settle for less
than the undisputed best
that's right we are the best
everywhere we go every time we do a show everybody wants to know how we make 'em say ho
the way we do is not a magical trick
it's just a lotta def rhymes just like this
somebody yell 'hooohooo-ho say 'ho ho' ho ho
now i'm the fresh prince hello how do you do?
i just have a little fun with the rest of my crew
so take a chill and just relax
yo ready c pretend that you're a dj and scratch
go ready rock go ready rock
all right now bust a move and get the hell out if you're tryin' to bust the groove
'cause we came to party - all through the night
and we're excommunicating those who don't act right this is a - party so grab somebody
drink some ba cardi and dance with everybody
the feeling's good some people think it's great
get on the dance floor and let your body dirate in cadence with the beat just move your feet
while the prince is on the rhyme ready c is on the beat
my beat box rocks everywhere we go getting utterly respected at every show
no other can beat me no girl can out-freak me man i'm getting tired
ready c give me a beat please
he does a lot that others cannot do ready c and the prince the toughest two man crew
we're coming out rockin' and we're takin' what's ours
ready c is the man and the suckers he devours
beat after beat he gains respect
ready c is the man that's keepin' others in check
i like to rock with him side by side
me and ready cold chillin' with the utmost pride
so if you're not down by law to rock the spot
then get the hell out 'cause we're never gonna stop
my beatbox we been rockin' kinda hard ever since we begun

that me and ready c will turn it out
do you know where you're goin' to

3,"now i'm the fresh prince and if you got good sense
you'll keep your distance because my sole intent
is to rock and shock the spot and give my all which is a lot
and no i'm not about to stop because i'm taking it to the top
a whole lot of people rap but what good is that
if the rap that they're rapping is way off track?
i don't mean to attack you but i'm cutting no slack
to those people that i hear saying meaningless raps
in actuality i mean in reality
the words that you use are a mere formality
vocabulary is not what it's about
the point that you're trying to get across is what counts
'cause when a lot of rappers rap they try to use big words
but that's the most absurd thing i've ever heard of
they think that that's impressive but when will they learn their lesson
that it's not the words that count it's the message
they get a lot of big words out of some magazine
and nine times out of ten they don't even know what they mean
they stand up on the stage huffing and puffin
rappin' for nearly an hour but they're not sayin' nothin'
really but a lot of jibberish
and i know that they all wish
they had access to fresh rhymes like this
i came to rock and shock and give my all which is a lot
and no i'm not about to stop because i'm takin' it to the top
fresh rhymes and a razzamatazz
smooth power and grace and mucho pizzazz
good looks and charm and personality
you punch it in your calculator and it adds up to me
i know the same goes for the rest of my crew
my dj jazzy jeff and ready rock c too
the ultimate combination of strength and prestige
my crew holds the key to fun and everything you need
to party all night yes it's you we will excite
the time is right so don't fight it suckers please don't bite it
we came to rock and shock and give our all which is a lot
and no we're not about to stop because we're takin' it to the top
i really hate to brag about him
but when people doubt him i have to stand up and tell the whole world all about him
'united we stand divided we fall'
is the moto of our crew and it is honored by all of us
we pledge allegiance to the work we rehearse
and it enables us always to come out first
we came to rock and shock and give our all which is a lot
yo jeff man why don't you take it to the top?
we succeed every time we attempt
to rock the house you've got to dance cause no one is exempt
from the rules set forth by us of course you know
stay out our way or behold the brute force of me jeff and ready rock c
we're a trio oh you didn't know?
that means that there's three of us one for all and all for one
and we're taking it to the top before we get done
i'm inclined to rhyme anytime you'll find
it ain't a rapper with a mind as impressive as mine i insist on a rise and i despise a decline
on the day i descend that's the day i resign i'm creating my trends and innovatin my rap
why is that? i don't know i guess i got it like that
my personality extends beyond the realm of mediocre
my advice for life is if you want somethin' go for it
cause there's nothin' that's beyond your grasp
just set your mind to it work hard and you can have
anything that you want the sky is the limit
stop lunchin around get up and go get it
'cause i came a long way from the past till today
now i'm never slowin down ah-ah no way
i came to rock and shock and give my all which is a lot
and no i'm not about to stop because i'm taking it to the top",1
4,"some dj's are good
some dj's are fresh
some dj's are even def
but here's a little sumtin about my dj
the magnificent
jazzy jeff
so bust this beat
well it's true that i'm the reigning kick of the throne
but with all my strength i couldn't do it alone
i need a dj like jazzy to back me up
so when i'm rockin' on the mic he's on the cross fade cut
scratching and mixing mixing and scratching
second after second it's the record he's catching
his hands are so fast that it's a medical riddle
with the turntables split and the mixer in the middle
back and forth his hands fly with the speed of a cheetah that will puzzle your eye
record after record he has no mercy
cuts left cuts right then he cuts vice versa
i'm not exaggerating i said it and i meant it
i'll resent it if you say it is cut unprecedented
he's a lean mean wrecking machine
he gets respected like a king when he's on the scene
so bust a move cause you know he's def
he's my dj
the magnificent
jazzy jeff

people often ask me every time i emcee
why do i brag so much about my disc jockey
well the reason that i brag and i boast the most
is cause my dj is the most from coast to coast
the magnificent jazzy jeff wack destroyer
cutting up records like a samurai warrior
if your dj's don't know who i'm talking too
i'm talking to you
so cut cause in a battle you cannot win
my dj will tear your butt limb from limb
he's like a wanna be tank a hip hop rebel
and if you want a battle you best bring a shovel my man
so you can dig your grave cause there no way
that you could ever be saved
cause the dj cuts the records
to create the sound
the dj cuts the records
he's the best around
the dj cuts the records
you know he's down
his name is jazzy jeff aka jeff townes
commanding the cut he's always on track
he's dj jazzy jeff and he's a cut in the act
so for your personal safety you should be told
that my dj jazzy jeff is
out of control
oh my god

now jazzy i want you to tell all these people how many of these dj's out there can get with you none of them
now make the record burp
say excuse me
now make the record sound like a bird
now make it chirp
now heres a story that should not be forgotten about the day my dj turned into an autobot
he got struck by lightning in an electrical storm
he got on the wheels of steel and began to transform
his name is jeff and he's the swift of the swift
the type that other dj's do not want to have to reckon with
he's by my side as i rock the mic
all of his vigorous cuts are sure to excite you
they'll delight you you no that that's right
if you were a stick of dynamite his cuts would ignite you
the dj on the wheels can be matched
so check out jazzy jeff with a cordless scratch",1
5,"each and every day when i come home from school
like clockwork i go up into my bedroom
i secure the door and it's the moment of truth
i flip on my sound system and let the bass loose
the earthquake bass makes the walls all tremble
a discotheque is what my room resembles
how loud it gets to me it does not matter
i open up the windows so the glass don't shatter
the blast falls off my neighbour's wall
my phone rings of the hook with complaint phone calls
but i just let it ring and i don't go near it
i turn the volume up so that i can't hear it ring
my ear drums rumble my lungs vibrate
i'm in my own world and this realm is great
we rock this power at my command
the decibels exceed the limits human ears can stand
the lower frequency better known as bass
sitting nice with the treble at a jazzy pace
my neighbours complain they say they can't endure
they form a congregation outside my front door
mothers who yell saying it's too loud
start banging on my door to turn it down
my response to my mother when she starts knockin'
is come on mum i'm just rockin'

rockin'
ready rock c

this style that's mine is rarely heard
suddenly there is an opportunity to observe
people gots my rhyme the super computer
the literary genius rhyme ruler of the future
i'm the fresh prince slaying all emcee
so hold the red cup when we take to your knees
pay home submit you can't defuse my scheme
'cause i'm the fresh prince and this is my regime
to all other rappers you're being subdued
i don't mean to be rude but this is my prelude
this introductory performance has just one plot
a sample jeff and about me and my dj rocks
i'm not listening to reason so don't try to talk
do yourself a favour and take a walk
or i'll amputate your mic and repossess your core
i'm the man salute to the prince the power lord
my friends i'll mangle you if we tangle put my arms in your asophogus and i'll strangle you
i'm the messiah or rhymes the verbal gladiator
i'm like a bomb and my turbo is the detonator
the crown chief of the poetry industry
vocabulary that to others is a fantasy
highly respected by the public at large
the prince will rock is taking charge
i'm like a tiger in a battle field i'm invincible
you want a battle me man be sensible
i'll never submit to any other emcee
be a duel to the death either him or me
and as i verbalise to my dj's cut
if we kill a wack crew or two so what
we just rock it

we just rock it
dj jeff
break 2

on each occasion that i perform
the force captures my body like a magical storm
suddenly i'm rendered helpless in a state of shock
but it is rather abrupt when i start to rock
adrenalin rushes my ego swells
and the yells of the crowd make my hype excel
my metabolism quickens my body gets sense
that's when i metamorphosise into the royal fresh prince
and as i display all my lyrical beauty
you become a slave as your hype increases
and as i vocalise i can see it in your eyes
you stand up as your enthusiasm levels rise higher and higher beyond the mark of red
you scream oh my to what the prince just said
as my energy is drained from being so crushed
all of a sudden i get another adrenalin rush
it happens each and every time that my dj spins
more commonly known as my second wind
the spotlights are beaming
you are screaming
from my body all the sweat is streaming
commanding the stage
and perpetually frayed
giving my all to the pulse of
one hundred percent every time i rhyme
when i step off the stage that's when the stop
and that has been the account of the evenings events
reporting to you live by me the fresh prince
i'm the latest that you heard so you may seem shockin
what does it all mean
i'm just rockin'
rockin' rockin' rockin'

go crazy

excuse me ice cream tee
hello how do you do

well i'm doing quite fine but i'm kind of upset
because i heard a little something i could not forget

girls may be trouble but guys are trouble too
you're a compulsive liar you mind is full of dirt

i think ruthfully your sick you need to be kicked
see i'm getting my loaded weapon you get on my nerve i go click
guys think they own their girlfriends females aren't possession's we are humans
we like to be wined and dined by candle light
not being couped up in the house trying to be held up tight
so jazzy jeff and fresh prince don't mean to bust your bubble
but guys of the world ain't nothin' but trouble
so homegirls next time a guy tries to give you the play
just turn your head and cold diss him and walk away

this amazing hot day i went to see barney from work
my briefcase in my hand sitting down on my skirt
the undergounds of the surface was the scene of my walk
i got approached from the rear e said baby can we talk
i looked him in the eyes with this fabulous smile
he said i just got paid lets hang out for a while
i said first would be my pleasure to know who you are
and do i have to use my tokens or do you have a car
well my name is the prince and i'm a great rap star
you don't have to use your tokens i've got a jaguar
i knew there was no doubt i'd jump on this mission
i proceeded to tell him my name with police suspicion
i said ice cream tee was the title i was given
swp the name of the hood i live in
so we jumped in the ride hit the 95 we turned into his block pulled up in his drive
first step in the house i saw a mouse
i said 90 in the wrong trips and then with the ow
he came running to my rescue he was a little late
my hair was broke my briefcase was in a totally different place
he said i'm sorry take a sip of this bacardi
and excuse me while i go freshen up for the party
i got a little confused i said party what's up with dude
he didn't even tell me i thought that was quite rude
suddenly through the door was three men in suits
they said hey sweet mama who are you
i said i'm ice cream tee and who may you be
i'm brother charles brother rick and he's brother ali
are you here to see the prince
prince no prince works for me i'm running the show

picked up the briefcase broke out on the double
these guys of the world are full of trouble

8,"yo jeff what's shakin man
what's up dude
ay man remember that girl you know when i was walking to school
she used to diss me everyday yeah
man the record came out she called me 2 days ago
man my phone is off the hook with people asking me for tapes and free records
i ain't with it
word man
bust this

this rap is for the people in the past who were against me
who snapped at every opportunity to diss me
put me down like i was nothing treated me like a jerk
now i'm seeing the pay off of all my hard work
but now that it's my records on the reel
somehow all of a sudden it's a whole new deal
for those in the past who dissed me don't deny it
what? your sorry? don't even try it

word man
people are a trip
putting everybody down what's up with that
word man i gotta let 'em know i gotta
bust this

i used to know this girl by the name of teresa
i did all i could to make her release her
emotions to me but she just wouldn't do it
she built up a wall and i couldn't break through it
i used to walk to school everyday of the week
watching teresa walk on the other side of the street
one day i finally got my heart up to speak
she dissed me and dismissed me with a smack on my cheek
so i bought 6 bottles of new fancy cologne
but all i got from teresa was
leave me alone
bought new clothes to wear every place
but all teresa would say was
get out of my face
so i gave up this quest for teresa
but then on the day my record was released
a strange thing happened when it came on the radio
teresa broke her neck just to say hello
i looked at her i said you must be foolish
why did you ignore me on the way to school if you were interested she said
oh i apologise
i looked deep into her dark brown eyes
i said you ignored me for months on end
now all of a sudden you wanna be my friend
you didn't talk before so don't talk now what be quiet
what you really like me? don't even try it

man she had a lot of nerve man word
but man she ain't have half as much nerve as that record producer
the one that dissed us man
what up

when i first started rapping i had one idea
and it was set in my mind very vivid and clear
i knew that i wanted to be a rap artist
i'll give my all and work my hardest
but when i took my song to a record producer
he told me that i better go drink some rap juice or
something because my song was really absurd
he said that it was the worst trash that he'd ever heard
yo my ego was shattered he busted my groove
i could hear him cracking up as i left the room
i thought my song was good but he busted my bubble
the title was girls ain't nothin' but trouble
hopefully i found domeone who had faith
he lifted my ego back up into place
his name was dana goodman chill he thought the song was on track
so two weeks later it was out on wax
it busted up the charts like a hydrogen bomb
up up up it climbed climbed climbed
people eat their words that said i couldn't achieve
now they have no choice bit to believe in me
then no sooner than my record came out
that same old producer started calling my house
one night he called me about half past 12
i've got some cash if you wanna sell
i said you big stupid half wit idiot
i told you before that my record was a hit
i just laughed like some kind of kid
now don't you regret what you did
i wish you'd get off my tip now that's my request
see he who laughs last always laughs best
okay i'll be reasonable you wanna buy it
okay i'll sell it psyche don't even try it

you know what i'll tell you sumthin
i got this so hard man
i'm a tell you sumthin

yo prince you remember when we first started out
how we used to go to all the parties just to rock the house
word man i remember those good days well
well chill out man 'cause i got a story to tell
about five years ago i began my quest to be the best dj in the whole us
there was a lot of dj's striving in my spot
they were putting me down every chance i got
never cut me a break on any given night
they used to all look at me and say
jeff's all right
but when your magnificent cuts were released
all of that left has ceased word
when you and i used to do our shows
all the crowd would say is ho
yeah time after time we were tearin it up
while you rock the mic and i rocked the cut
but now that i'm making a name for myself
all those dj's are like

the'yll push me on the street and say

1,"once upon a time brooklyn was the scene
in the project that they called fort greene
there lived a young man cinderfella's his name
to make it interesting it's me dana dane
i lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
and two step-brothers who treated me bad
i cooked i cleaned i scrubbed the floors
and i was like an errand boy runnin' to the stores
my brothers they used to boast and brag
'we've got fresh gear and you've got rags'
even worse than that to make me feel low
they gave me a straw hat while they had kangols
girls used to say 'dane you're so cute
but you gets no rap with them polyester suits'
well one day up the avenue
there was a man surrounded by the fort greene crew
he said 'hear ye hear ye come one come all
the princess is having a royal ball
if you can rap also dress fresh
you might win a date with the sweet princess'
well i um ran home when i heard the newsflash
i bust through the door straight to my step-dad
i said 'step-dad may i?'
and before i could finish 'hell no' he replied
my brothers were goin' they were geared down
even pops was goin' for a piece of the crown
they flaunted they haunted they knew what i wanted
'we can and you can't' is what they taunted
they all stood there laughing in my face
and as they walked out they said 'clean up this place'

cinderfella dana dane
but i'm the rapper dana dane with fame
cinderfella dana dane
yes i'm the rapper dana dane with fame

well i shrugged i hissed 'they're all tryna diss
i'd get them back if i had one wish'
before i could make my thought a phrase
there appeared a man from a puff of haze
he said 'what's up dane? my name is hurb
i'm your fairy godfather you know it word
now i've came here with the main purpose
of granting you your fondest wish'
i said 'hurb my man just make me fresh
and i'm sure that i can handle all the rest'
with a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
and i was tough and on my body a slick silk suit
on my feet there was argyle socks
and a fresh pair of ballys from the bally shop
i showed him my hat and don't you know
with a snap the hat became a kangol
once again his hands began to flow
then he changed my skateboard into a volvo
he checked me over passed me the keys
and said 'one more thing before you leave
you must return before the stroke of twelve
or you'll turn back into your old self'

cinderfella dana dane
but i'm the rapper dana dane with fame
cinderfella dana dane
yes i'm the rapper dana dane with fame

i jumped in the volvo went on my way
i got to the party 'bout ten i'd say
it was after eleven when i rocked the mic
and by the time i left the stage the people were hyped
the princess was staring in disbelief
reflected from her eyes were my gold teeth
she waved her hands like 'hello hi'
then gave another gesture like 'come here guy'
i left the stage girls came in flocks
fists were swingin' from the hard rocks
i heard a sound not a tick nor tock
gong first bell before twelve o'clock
no time to waste i broke out in haste
the princess followed in a futile chase
a quick steady pace is what i kept
lost one of my ballys on one of those steps
for the volvo i continued my stride
about this time i heard gong five
i was down the block when i heard gong eight
and the princess scream out 'wait wait wait wait'

cinderfella dana dane
but i'm the rapper dana dane with fame
cinderfella dana dane
yes i'm the rapper dana dane with fame

i was almost home when my luck ran out
and there went my suit my kangol and clothes
my fresh volvo also went too
and there was no denyin' that my night was through
the one bally shoe the freshest thing i sported
jumped on my board for home i skateboarded
made it to my pad no time at all
went to my room or better yet the far wall
hid the shoe away still feelin' pleased
then jumped in my cot to catch some z's
early the next morning when i awoke
i threw on me old slippers and me old housecoat
went into the front my family stared at me
sayin' 'wasn't that you? nah it couldn't be'
they kept askin' me as i did my chores
my butt was saved by a knock on the door
'who is it?' that's what my brothers barked
'the princess' this sweet voice remarked
she said she was lookin' for a certain man
who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
the family ran around with their heads in the air
bringin' on shoes from everywhere
she just shook her head a nod of relief
sayin' 'no that's not the one that i'm lookin' for chief'
i ran in the room and got my shoe
and said 'is this the one you're referring to?'
well she said 'yes and you're so cute
but where's your kangol and slick silk suit?'
i put on the shoe there came a flash of light
and i was tough in the gear from just last night
looked out the window saw the volvo
said to my family 'i've got to go'
we drove up the avenue the princess and i
and in back of me i heard my family cry

but i'm the rapper dana dane with fame

yes i'm the rapper dana dane with fame

4,"next stop delancey street
step lively and ah - watch the closing doors

i can't express it any plainer
that i'm a entertainer
people call me dane but my real name is dana
i've came here just to put you on
'cause i'm taking the rapping world by storm
in the rap i've made a change
a change that no other out there can claim
now what i've done will make you laugh
so don't you ever be offended by the words i pass
i'll make you tickle make your butt wiggle
you'll tell your friends and they'll chuckle and giggle
now this little story's called delancey street
it's the place where clothes are bought and people meet
each city has a place that's quite the same
even though it might go by a different name

delancey street
delancey stree-eet
delancey street
this story can't be beat

well i went to delancey street to buy some wears
even though i already had on fresh gear
go into the store to buy a kangol
i took out my wallet and my fat money roll
when three females walked up to me
there was a white a black the other chinese
the white girl said my name is dawn
and i love your gear by louis vuitton
the black girl said my name is jane
and she couldn't keep her hands off the fresh gold chains
the chinese girl her name sushi
she was foggin up the '86 guccis
i thought they wanted to conversate
then they all pulled out a six-shooter trey-eight
three fresh females who would have thought
'cause they tried to rob me i almost got caught
i stood there for a minute tried to concentrate
i tried to think of a way for me to escape
no one in sight one thing to do
you mean you ran dana dane? damn right i flew
up the block and through an alley
yo i cold dogged my fresh new bally's
i ran through some water and some dog -
but i don't give a damn i wouldn't be their vic'
oh no not me not while i have feet
so then i dipped over to orchard street
around the corner past the brick house
and right in back of me droolin from the mouth
yes them three females at hot pursuit
then all of a sudden they began to shoot
i flundered blundred all the shots thundered
where did you run? that's what i wondered
so confused my head still in the wind
a sign up the street that read dead end

now here they came just as plain as day
runnin' down the street like _three the hard way_
i approached the stop the temper grew
and then the girl screams out yo damn it don't move
they continued strong like the quiet storm
lover boy run everything that you've got on
run your gucci your louis and your fresh gold chains
and your bally shoes we want it all from you
now max this move what could i do?
nowhere to run no one to run to
the girls just didn't know who i am
but i knew a way to get out this jam
i stood in their face took on the loud racket
opened up my ??? jacket
printed on my shirt yes there's bold and plain
'i'm not the one the rapper dana dane'
well the girls caught the message it was plain to see
they might as well have said dana dane you're free
cause jane came by she winked her eye
and dawn came over grabbed me at my fly
and that's about the time when sushi came near
she kissed me on my cheek and blew in my ear
each one of them tryin' to grab my hand
screamin leave him to the other dana dane's my man
i knew it they'd blew it
punches were thrown they got into it
they rumbled battled wrestled like cattle
she made me do it they began to tattle
swollen eyes and busted lips
'cause i think all of them got pistol-whipped
but i don't care do you hear what i say?
i just wiped off my bally's went on my way
and they're still not friends till this very da",1

but she was all up on me breathin in my face
you may think i'm lyin' though it's just a dream
this girl had the baddest breath i'd ever seen
i couldn't think straight thought i was doomed
heard a bling-bling-bling it was time for homeroom
i stepped real quick she tried to play it sassy
she almost ran me down this nasty fatnastee
dipped to the stairs running blind
get to my homeroom ran through my mind
got to the 4th floor standin in the door
girlies watchin me walk down the corridor
the guys they were jealous and gettin' mad
and all the girlies wishin they had the class i had
got to my classroom expect to see the teacher
who did i see? that ugly black creature
paused for a minute standin in the door
then i broke out when the girlie went raw
word 'em up doc couldn't stand the smell
heard of 3d? well she was fat as hell
i ran out the school i didn't look back
i tell you dr slumber this girl was wack
and that's about the time when i awoke
and i smelled that awful breath that almost made me choke
now tell me dr slumber how can it be?
that this dream somehow became reality?
i can't go to sleep 'cause i'm so damn scared
'cause i keep havin' these crazy nightmares

nightmares of the night nightmares
nightmares they're all right nightmares
'cause they just show imagination of reality nightmares
just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe nightmares
nightmares

she said listen dana dane i think i have the cure
but i have to hear one more before i'll be sure
i laid back my head tried to concentrate
then i told her the nightmare 'bout the blind date
had a blind date with this girl named anita
the fever's the place i'm supposed to meet her
saw the def body with the vicious butt
how did i know she was a marvelous mutt
this lady i met was as ugly as hell
couldn't go in the jam with this female
i was coughin hard she started to braggin
couldn't let them know i was here with this dragon
grabbed her hand dipped to harlem world
but i left this ugly lady for another girl
now this other female her name was denise
couldn't get no rapture there followed the beast
everywhere i turn everywhere i look
there was anita the beast she could not be shook
i dipped i dived i ran i thrived
but there was no place that i could hide
'cause she was sniffin me out like a hungry blood hound
her tail in the air her nose to the ground
only thing left for me to do
was to set her up with this other dude
now this other dude he was real upset
cause this ugly female he didn't wanna check
he started actin' wild even called me a faggot
what could i do he had a 22 automatic
i dipped into the crowd made my way to the door
bumped into this object and i hit the floor
when i looked up what did i see?
i saw anita the beast lookin' down at me
i couldn't try to play it couldn't try to pretend
like the aftca i had to take the dog in

nightmares of the night nightmares
nightmares they're all right nightmares
'cause they just show imagination of reality nightmares
just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe nightmares
nightmares

now i pleaded dr slumber i just can't bare
to have another one of these crazy nightmares
then all of a sudden she turned around
and starin' at me with that all-white gown
with a catholic smile showin all her teeth
was that ugly female anita the beast

dr slumber her sweet soft voice turning horrifying
dana?
dana honey wake up
what's wrong?
wake up honey
you are just having a nightmare
a-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
a-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha",1
0,"hey yeah yeah
you got it goin' on
oh na na na na

now i wrote this record for when i perform
on the nights inside a university dorm
i put pen to paper with the paper to pen
for the times i'm rockin' the mic in front of women and men

i get raw like eddie rough like freddie
kruger with a luger turning men into spaghetti
i'm like fats domino off of blueberry hill
because my rhymes are funky-fresh and not run of the mill
so like a king has palaces i give an analysis
you can't talk because you're suffering paralysis
if the mouth of the lip of the tongue
coming to you compliments of a brother named young
now you can't talk because i'm leaving you speechless
so be quiet let an educator teach this
i speak to my producer so he's in a rage
so like he controls the vinyl i control the stage
'cause i come off
yo i come off

four score and seven years ago
there were a whole bunch of rappers who were in the know
four score and seven years later
i dig holes in those rappers like the moon with a crater
because to battle me you're really taking a risk
'cause you're an 8-track tape and i'm a compact disc
like tyson drops boxers in rapid succession
that's how i'm dropping rappers in the rappin' profession
i'm comin' off
just like the clothes on a hooker
and i can fly just like jimmy 'superfly' snuka
like the shuttle goes up into outer space
people's hands go up when i enter the place
i don't mean to brag or boast or try to tell you i'm great
but i can rock the microphone like dorothy hamil can skate
yeah i can say a funky rhyme like greg louganis can dive
don't have to be saturday night for young mc to come off
yo i come off
my name is young mc and baby i come off
yo the brother's comin' off
bust this

a-here we go
a-here we go
a-here we go
come on come on come on come on
here we go
here we go
a-here we go
come on come on come on come on
a-here we go

lo and behold young mc struck gold
from the rhymes that i been singing to the young and the old
from the battles i've been having with the smart and the dumb
from the records i've been making with the mic and the drum
you know the other rappers wanna play a game with me
they run and hide when they hear the name of young mc
like a kid playing tag it's how it's got to be
so when i start i say olly olly oxen free
yo you could never write a rhyme as strong as this one
so pay attention 'cause you don't wanna miss one
of my healthy rhymes nobody's are healthier
new york new jersey la and philadelphia
city to city and town to town
place to place country to country 'cause i get around
even if you were in prison you'da heard me play
because the warden'd have me rockin' up on the pa

so when you get out come and see my show
but if you start static back in you go
'cause comin' off is the title and the theme of my jam
and when the rhymes are finally finished people say goddamn
'cause i come off
i come off
yo baby i come off

a-here we go
a-here we go
a-here we go
come on come on come on come on come on",1
1,"now normally if i can help it
i don't spend a lot of time in the principal's office

what? nine o'clock

now as i get to school i hear the late bell ringing
running through the hall i hear the glee club singing
get to the office i can hardly speak
'cause it's the third late pass that i got this week
so to my first class i run and don't walk
all i hear is my sneakers and the scratching of chalk
and when i get to the room i hear the teacher say
mr young i'm happy that you could join us today
i try to sit down so i can take some notes
but i can't read what the kid next to me wrote
and if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete
as i try to get up i find there's gum on my seat
and with the seat stuck to me i raise my hand and say
excuse me but can i go to the bathroom ma'am?
the teacher got upset and she screamed out no
it's off to the principal's office you go

twelve o'clock comes with mass hysteria
everybody rushes down to the cafeteria
picked up my tray to have thursday's lunch
and when i tried the applesauce i heard it crunch
i'm running up the stairs with a front tooth broken
the nurse just laughed and says you must be jokin'
i looked up at her with a smile on my face
no joke 'cause my front tooth is out of place
so i walk through school with ice on my lip
a nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip
my books are real heavy i walk and i'm dragging it
no school lunch next week i'm brown-bagging it
forget class i'ma shoot some ball
with a late pass i've got no trouble at all
but then the nurse walks up and says whaddya know?
it's off to the principal's office you go

recess

passing notes is my favorite pastime
i can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to
to express my feelings
give me a week me and the girl will be dealin'
now one young lady was looking at me
i said hi my name is marvin known as young mc
but then the bell rang and the teacher came in
and that's when the game of passing notes will begin
i wrote the first note told her she was fine
and i hope that the two of us could spend some time
she wrote me back and told me you're fine too
i'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you
so then i sat there reeling and looking at the ceiling
words can't express the way that i was feeling
then i thought to myself the sure way to get her
is to write another note oh yes a love letter
when i finished the note it was ready to pass
the teacher took it and read it right in front of the class
she read it word by word and line by line
and everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine
even my girl was laughing it was too late
no need to write another note 'cause there would be no date
the teacher looked at me and i said i know
it's off to the principal's office i go

yo you think this bad?
wait till i get my report card",1
2,"bust it

this here's a jam for all the fellas
try to do what those ladies tell us
get shot down 'cause you're overzealous
play hard to get females get jealous

ok smarty go to a party
girls are scantily clad and showin' body
a chick walks by you wish you could sex her
but you're standin' on the wall like you was poindexter

next day's function high class luncheon
food is served and you're stone cold munchin'
music comes on people start to dance
but then you ate so much nearly split your pants

a girl starts walkin' guys start gawkin'
sits down next to you and starts talkin'
says she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove
so come on fatso and just bust a move

just bust a move

you're on a mission and you're wishin'
someone could cure your lonely condition
lookin' for love in all the wrong places
no fine girls just ugly faces

from frustration first inclination
is to become a monk and leave the situation
but every dark tunnel has a light a hope
so don't hang yourself wit a celibate rope

new movie's showin' so you're goin'
could care less about the five you're blowin'
theater gets dark just to start the show
then you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row

she's dressed in yellow she says hello
come sit next to me you fine fellow
you run over there without a second to lose
and what comes next? hey bust a move

if you want it you got it
if you want it baby you got it just bust a move
if you want it you got it
if you want it baby you got it

in the city ladies look pretty
guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
tell a funny joke just to get some play
then you try to make a move and she says no way

girls are fakin' goodness sakin'
they want a man who brings home the bacon
got no money and you got no car
then you got no woman and there you are

some girls are sadistic materialistic
looking for a man makes them opportunistic
they're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan
so that a brother with money can be their man

so on the beach you're strollin' real high-rollin'
everything you have is yours and not stolen
a girl runs up with somethin' to prove
so don't just stand there bust a move

if you want it you got it
if you want it baby you got it just bust a move
if you want it you got it
if you want it baby you got it break it down for me fellas

your best friend harry has a brother larry
in five days from now he's gonna marry
he's hopin' you can make it there if you can
'cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man

you say neato check your libido
and roll to the church in your new tuxedo
the bride walks down just to start the wedding
and there's one more girl you won't be getting

so you start thinkin' then you start blinkin'
a bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'
she thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
and now you're feelin' really firm 'cause the girl is stacked

reception's jumpin' bass is pumpin'
look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
says she wanna dance to a different groove

non stop for the treble non stop for the bass
non stop for the brotha' who is on the case

to get the people on the floor in three minutes or less
there'll be no time for cuttin' no time for mix
to do in three what other rappers can't do in six
'cause i was chillin' at a party the record was playin'
this is brand new that's what the dj was sayin'
but no matter what the people stand on the wall
they'd have more fun goin' shoppin' at a shoppin' mall
so then the dj called me over to help out that night
he said yo yo that's young mc i said yo yo that's right
so then i grabbed the microphone the party started to hop
'cause when i start you know i go non stop

7,"roll with the punches is what i tell
to people when things don't go to well

when you go for the gold and come back empty
when the ups are few and the downs are plenty

when you talk with the girl that you always desired
you busted a move but the move backfired
when life puts you in the little crunches
don't give up
you've got to roll with the punches

roll it baby

work-
no matter what occupation
any times good time for vacation
everyday's the same you can't believe the monotony
so when the weekend comes it's like you had a lobotomy

you can't do a thing without the boss start yellin'
it wouldn't be bad if his breath wasn't smellin'

a good days work for a good days pay
but that's before uncle sam takes a portion away

now alot of times you feel just like quitin'
but without a job your home alone sittin'

checkin' the want ads for jobs to fill
watchin soaps geraldo and oprah and phil

my advice is to roll with with it honey
and soon you'll find that you'll be in the money
expense accounts and three martini lunches
and that's what you get when you
roll with the punches

roll it baby-

you got to roll with the punches-

roll with it

roll it baby-

lotto
take your chance for a dollar
if i win then i'll scream and holla
high on the hog is the way to be
and its def livinin in the lap of luxury

i picked 4 numbers they were all ok
for the 5th and 6th i used my birthday
but i erased my birthday and said better yet
i'll use the birthday of a girlie that i just met

i filled out the ticket gave it a kiss for luck
handed it to the agent
with a brand new buck

went home to watch tv on a saturday night
4 numbers came up and they were all all right

now what happened next nearly made me drop dead
it wasn't her birthday it was mine instead
i said next time i'll just play my hunches
but what the heck i'll just roll with the punches

roll with it

you got to go with the flow

like this

women
let me tell you about em
can't live with them
can't live without em
the ones you like only seem to hate you
the ones you hate only seem to date you

girls will often tell you
you come on too strong
you got to take it slow to make the love last long
but i say
the early bird cathces the worm
the late bird gets the gilrie with the two dollar perm

man that put me in dilema
case in point a fly girl name gema
i met this lady at a quiet place
about 5 years ago we were face to face

i stepped up to her
tossed the first line
like fishin' i was wishin'
that the girl would be mine

i told my best jokes and she started smilin'
a voice inside said yo young your stylin'

but then gema really startin actin' silly
'cause she broke up with her boyfriend billie
she wanted advice and she was coming to me

i said you need dear abby not the young mc
because i don't mind being a shoulder to cry on
but i need one who needs a body to lie on

'cause nowadays i got girls by the bunches
see i got smart and just rolled with the punches

roll it baby

you got to go with the flow

roll it baby

nowadays i got girls by the bunches
i got smart and just rolled with the punches",1
8,"ladies and gentlemen
in the next ten rounds for the heavyweight championship of the world

now i have won 1 million battles take mcs round 'em up like cattle
brand 'em and then i lock 'em up in a pen
and if they want another try then i will do it again
because my name is young mc and rockin' a mic is my craft
but when i first started everyone just laughed
'cause i got rocked 'n' rolled left out in the cold
'cause i was tryin' to battle men when i was ten years old
but time went by and i got wise
and every time i did a party well i opened my eyes
until now ya see before the guy who won't ignore ya
won't be talkin' about the girlies like i read on latoya
see i am just that kind of fella
sometimes rough most other time mellow
gather a crowd when i start rappin' out loud
and i am here to rock a party that's what i vowed
so just like clark kent is into superman
i become a super hero when the mic's in my hand
'cause i am hard to swallow a tough act to follow
i'm solid straight through while the others are hollow
'cause i been rockin' parties since i was a child
and every time place that i went i made the crowd go wild
it wasn't hard for me to do it there was really nothing to it
and not once did i hear someone say yo young mc ya blew it
so listen party people i got something to say
i guess i'm just like burger king because you have it your way
you know it makes me delighted to think that i'm a rhymin' writer
so next time i have a party i'll make sure that your invited
the jam of the year i'll hold it right here
and after all is said and done i like to make it quite clear
that i came here tonight to have some fun my name is young mc
backwards it's mc young i let 'em know

i let 'em know

now one an' one is two and two an' two make four
my name is young i rock the house we're talkin' rhymes galore
it doesn't matter who you are or who you want to be
you'll never ever rock as nasty as the young mc
so now darlin' darlin' come and see my show
you want a ticket then i get you one in the front row
and you can bring a friend yes a girl perhaps
and when the show is over come sit on my lap
because you can't resist me neither can your friend
it starts in the beginnin' finishes up at the end
and all these others come around and swear they're better than me
when they can't even deal with the young mc
i mean they think they in command but they're out of control
they think that they're out of jail they're only on parole
they think they're walkin' on water when they're on a jet ski
they think they hot on the mic they ain't as hot as me
they think they flyin' through the air when they on a plane
they think they have a sound mind when they goin' insane
they think they lyin' on the beach when there ain't no sand
they think that they the freshest rapper they ain't heard the man
so let me tell you party people this is how it goes
i am the one you listen to 'cause i'm the one you choose
and if you think they competition they can deal with me
here is my number call the house the name is young mc
i let 'em know

you know what i'm sayin'?
i let 'em know

break it down

they said a boy is a boy and a girl is a girl
and young mc he is a rapper ready to rock world
i am a man with a skill of a duty to fulfill
of party goers every which without the need to get ill
no need to scream and to shout 'cause that's not what i'm about
'cause i'm a man who's rockin' the jams to this there is no doubt
continuing with my tale to never flop or to fail
be good to you just like a discount at a one day sale
i'm not a criminal or hood neither the riff or raff
if every rapper was a comic i'd be makin' you laugh
if every rapper was a worker i'd be chief of the staff
and on a scale of one to ten i am a ten and a half
if every rapper was a lion i'd be king of the beast
if every rapper was a cop i'd be chief of police
if every rapper was a solder i would be rambo
if every rapper was hawaiian i would be don ho
you're a fish who's out of water i'm a great white shark
i'm a healthy burst of lightin' you're a shot in the dark
i'm a law abidin' citizen you're breakin' the laws
and i'm a man who's almost perfect you're filled with flaws
this is not exaggeration this is straight up truth
rap is to me what good sex is to dr ruth
rap is just like sex 'cause i'm aimin' to please
but when you're listenin' to my rhyme you'll never catch a disease
now like a man once said when you're slow ya blow
to prevent against this i'm always good to go
never ever frontin' moves i'm makin' sure of stuff
and when the mic is in my hand that's when the stuff get r-r-r-rough
'cause i'm a man who's on a mission and i'm not done yet
'cause this is rougher then the roughest of the rough stuff yet
i make noise like a smoke detector when there's smoke
and i'm good to go so now you know the young mc's no joke
i let 'em know

word 'em up i let 'em know

dare it is",1
9,"i'm shovin' off like an ocean liner
no one can rock the microphone finer
east west north south carolina
alex and vivian chillin' at mel's diner
off to china 'cause i got a show there
get my passport then i'm gonna go there
who do i know there? i guess no one
but i will have fun and i get the job done
on the airplane movin' like the concord
come and join me everybody on board
you won't be bored with the stuff i'm pickin' up
watch me quicken up and with the pace i pick it up
pick up the pace

second verse and never cursin'
rockin' the microphone with the style that i'm reherasin'
in person that means liver
swimmin' and slimmin' just like a deep sea diver
i'll arrive uh just to go faster
grab the microphone and show that i am the master
of disaster cookin' up a potion
with the funky rhymes to put the people into motion
of the ocean movin' like the water
here's the menu go place your order
it's a slaughter a felony of chatter
and pickin' up the pace is the subject matter

break it down
oh yes i pick up the pace
take a look at the crowd and take a look at my face
listen to my rhyme and listen to them yell
it's like a man in jail gettin' out of the cell
i don't why they go by
weak names and swear that they're so fly
they gotta try it again to rock the mic my friend
go from a to z and from beginning to end
now i could go slower like the other guys do
but i ain't with it that's what i'm tellin' you
i think it's kind of stupid i think it's a disgrace
instead of going slow they should be pickin' up the pace
like this
rock and roller
coca-cola
hot like soda
rollin' like a boulder
dancin' prancin' mic enhancin'
just give me a chance and girls i'm romancin'
understand it underhanded
leavin' you stranded runnin' like a bandit
yo young money in my hands you're putty
i'm pickin' up the pace and rockin' the mic
yeah buddy

pick up the pace",1
10,"now from planet to planet and from star to star
it doesn't really matter baby just who you are
and from earth to solar system and to galaxy
it's real hard to get a ticket to hear young mc
because i rock like a professional this ain't no lark
you either hear me at a party or you see me in the park
i rocked the many places far away from my home
i guess that must be the reason why i'm so well known
i rocked from iowa to idaho canada to mexico
i came into the place you party people just to let you know
my name is the young mc ladies want to come to me
and when they're in my arms the ladies never ever front on me
thinkin' that you know the deal boy why don't you be for real
i love to rock the mic and sometimes even rock the wheels of steel
rock the place without a doubt now i'm gonna turn it out
so listen very close so i can tell you that it's all about
rhymes

more rhymes
party people i'm the young mc and i got rhymes
let me tell you something
young mc got more rhymes

now with a voice like this i rock so well
but i'm not prince lionel richie or patti labelle
i'm not the cars the pretenders or the b-52's
my name is young mc and i'm the one you should choose
'cause when the music comes in the beat starts thumpin
and i'm the only man to keep the girlies high jumpin'
i'm the doctor on the mic and yes i'm so sure
that all you need is one visit then you'll be cured
cause in the game of rap i am the referee
when the others need help they'll come to me
like judge joe wapner on the _people's court_
my name is young mc rockin' on the mic is my sport
and now you know just from those 12 lines
that a fella like me never falls behind
'cause i'm the cream of the crop and the leader of the pack
once you give me the mic you know there's no turnin' back
because i got more rhymes then the other guys do
they're just a monkey i'm the whole damn zoo
i can't use a book i use a hefty bag
because they're just a string i'm the american flag
i got more rhymes than water seen by a sailor
more than husbands of elizabeth taylor
more than babe ruth has hit home runs
yo my name is young mc so go out there and have some fun
with rhymes

more rhymes
i gotta tell you something
young mc got rhymes
party people i got more rhymes

bust it

rhymes - what are these things that i talk about?
hear them in the walkman every time you wanna walk about
never lost a battle in which i fought
and if rhyme was a crime i'd never get caught
i had to go to college because i am an intellectual
i only sleep with women 'cause i am heterosexual
rock the microphone anyplace anytime
that's why i had to write a jam and call it got more rhymes
now as a consequence of this
i'd like to make some sense of this
and tell the party people all the reasons that i sent you this
rhyme that i continue to say
school starts in september graduation in may
and when i graduate rhymes'll keep comin'
girls try to flock and jock but stop bummin
'cause i'm the kinda guy that you never wanna toy with
and now you know that i'm talkin' about the boy with
rhymes

more rhymes
when you say young mc you are sayin' rhymes
party people young mc got more rhymes
yeah",1
11,"now this rhyme right here has been dedicated
to all rap fans that said that they hated
the other mc's whose rhymes deviated
'cause this is real gold it's not gold plated
a few years ago these rhymes were created
i was real proud and very elated
it took a long time as i claculated
but now i look back i'm glad i waited
at so many times i was so frustrated
'cause i couldn't finish up what i initiated
i got mad and quite agitated
and i remember rhymes that i had confiscated
but one day this girl she perpetrated
she was cute and quite educated
we got married at once an it was consummated
but once it hit the books it was ill-fated
she took me to court to have it liligated
a judge and a jury that's how it operated
the jury went away and they deliberated
then she took all of my money had my house renivated
i felt so poor and so humilated
because of a fight that i instigated
but i got my money back and i was jubilated
'cause the first court decision was never validated
for weeks and weeks i just celebrated
because the jury and judge recapitulated
and all of my funds were never liquadated
yes i won yes i dominated
i saw another girl and my heart pulsated
she just looked like that girl i made it
would've have been part two of this rhyme that i've stated
so i'll just go home and read my sports illustrated",1
12,"attention party people
it's an apb
that is an all points bulletin from young mc
now if you're a senior citizen or just a tike
just grab a seat and pay attention as i rock the mic
i wrote a couple of rhymes
and called them just say no
dedicated to the people who are on the go
and we can't help you out if you're on the brink
and if you listen this jam will make you think
if you were ever in a situation
without enough time for contemplation
all of your friends goin' the same way
you feel kinda trapped
you don't know what to say
just say no
'cause better safe than sorry
this is for real
this ain't no game or folly
it's your life and you only got one
so you better do it right
or it will soon be done
you want to be popular
you want to be cool
you want to be the one that everybody likes in school
you want to be everything for everyone else
but you better think of what you want to be for yourself
everyday people livin' in the same old mess
it's hard to be original and not be like the rest
you've got to go for what you know
you can't afford to guess
and heaven knows what would happen if you did say yes
so say no
just say no
you hear me?
say no
just say no
kids od'ing cause the families grief
over the marijuana plant and the coca leaf
over a bunch of pills to try to get their thrills
over a drug you shoot because you think it's cute
over something you smoke
man it ain't no joke
over something you drink
oh boy why don't you think?
over something you snort like you were playing a sport
one day you'll go too far and you'll come up short
some people out there don't seem to get my point
telling others crack kills while they're smoking a joint
well the point of this song is to tell you the facts
some people die from smoking reefer like they die from crack
not a drug in particular
but drugs in general
they're not good for you like a vitamin or a mineral
they come in liquid leafs powder pill and rocks
they'll put you six feet under on your back in a box
so say no
just say no

say no
just say no",1

two bottles of dom got his hands filled
and so goes the days of our lives as the hourglass sand spill
and built with passion and a glass of the 'ze
and the lights went down and hey

and i knew it was the last day  wig-twisting season
when some could get their wigs twisted back within reason
mostly with these crimes of treason
and you'll be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening
from how he's feeling thrilling choice of flow is sick
he's the villain with the million dollar voice-throat trick
he's like a ventriloquist with his fist in the speaker's back
couldn't think of no uniquer track nope sneak attack
it don't really matter how big them is so much as a nipple
'cause you could have a chick with d-triple
'cept the nipple little just hot off the griddle
like how he do monkey rhymers like monkey-in-the-middle by his damn self
ain't no average mc ahead of me
getting cheddar instead of the probably better pedigree
with nicknames sick games as rick james
messy games sci-fi such as jesse james

got bagged 'cause of the dirty chick with make-up
bail out quick for the 730 wake-up

to when the leaves turn red and gold to nimrod's earthday
all else? worthless to say

that's when i knew it was the first day  wig-twisting season
when some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
mostly with these crimes of treason men
and y'all be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening

it's like a mosquit-ah the much sweeter resent the act
i been bent back since my physical went back
since cultured more of my kin
and for them i keep an l rolled in this hellhole
hold your head use your head and hold or be dead and cold
in the worsest way soon as the leaves show red and gold
to 'round nimrod's release day
and all else? needless to say

wait a motherfucking minute true facts presented
the names was probably changed just to protect who ain't in it
the xp was three-quarters tinted 4/5ths was converted
the way his shit was twisted? ask him if it hurted

 wig-twisting season
when some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
mostly with these crimes of lying and fronting and cheating

she stepped to me the same way at a no shame pace
i'm off guard her game had me choked up

what's the hero who's the villain?
dead or livin' killed or killin' who the fuck should remain chillin'?
doom webster says wicked and evil but yo who's webster?
nihilation and outcast equals freedom that's so fast
culture in chains that be the rolls villain plays
all these are just metaphors they describe symbols in folklore
but who knows why it's like this?
hero? hit or old miss? maybe it's all good
really of god but who should determine the real
evil what's the deal
fools rush in they don't know the yin from the yang
and are ashamed to deviate or act sane
from the norm they are slaves forced to conform
to really find your essence take this as a lesson
break away from the rest of them
get from the form ending like the villain in the song
find truth who determines wrong
from right without a fistfight
different from day than from night {operation doomsday}
it's just a simple play on words
delete all these punks ass herbs
who's the hero what's the villain?
the question still remains chillin'

word he down there buggin
he got them illin out they shootin and everything else

the prophet
let's continue the saga mad mad drama
i met this chick she said she knew where ignorance was at
i said where? she said downtown
he had babies havin' babies - and young niggaz sellin crack
i think the bitch is lyin' it's a set up
i can smell it but ignorance is runnin' rampant
aight baby show me the exact spot
meet me at hoyt and schermerhorn at 3 on the dot
so i hops up on the a-train i'm bein followed
my seventh sense senses danger
i turn around it's anger
and he brought a mob along it's the same old song
despair and animosity got broke with the swiftness
i don't know what they think this is
i feel a sharp pain in my neck now i can't see i'm like hiram
they hit me with the dart filled with the pork chop serum
i tried to hold on but before long i dropped
when i awoke i was locked in the barber's shop
trapped in the barber's chair
oh no they're gonna try and cut my hair
but that can't stop the prophet

anger
yo prophet
ignorance is tired of you followin him around
we about to put an end to that right now
anamosity yea despair yo whassup? get him

{dj premier cuts and scratches can't a damn thing stop me}

the prophet
a few minutes passed by i hear a buzzin noise
it was that chick with some of ignorance's boys
she said prophet we got you beat
by the way i'm mr ignorance's wife deceit
but enough talk now for your hair cut
when the clippers touched my hair they blew the fuck up
after the explosion there was no one left
'cause i know dim mak/poison hand/touch of death
my vision's still kinda blurry but i see a clue
ignorance is at the library
i hurry with lightning speed like the flash
he's at the big one on grand army plaz'
when i get inside the doors shut and the lights go off
damn another trap
i hear a hissin sound i smell a funny smell
i gasp i can't breathe
ignorance is laughin' at me
waitin on my downfall but he can't stop the prophet

mr ignorance
well prophet
it seems like you're in a bit of a jam
i hope you can unstick yourself
oh and what you did to my wife it was nothing
i have others
hahahahahaha hahahahaha hahahahahah

the saga continues",2
8,"'now i don't be foolin' around i tell the truth nothin' is secret'

as devils search for the secrets to immortality
i alter my physical chemistry
walk through the valley of the shadow of death
i exist even when no things are left
vibrations transcend space and time
pure at heart because i deal with the mind
that's why i compose these verses
audible worlds my thoughts are now universes
written on these pages is the ageless
wisdom of the sages ignorance is contagious
so i hope you keep your focus
there's no hocus-pocus in the end it's just us
devil got brother killin' brother it's insane
goin' out like abel and cain
wisen up and use your brain
there'll be no limit to the things that you can gain
in positivity balance it with negativity
until then ain't the devil happy

ain't the devil happy

i hate when the devil's happy so i wear my hair hair nappy
knotty won't go out like john gotti
he came from the caves to destroy everybody
and we like fools destroy our own bodies
too many niggaz chillin' bad boys boom boom
this leaves no room for the flowers to bloom
seeds blow in the wind another drug killin'
what are we accomplishin'? nothin'
what's the matter?
why every time i look around another brain gets splattered?
some pockets get fatter but it don't matter
the devil's the only one who really gets fatter
lead ruptures flesh spleens are shattered
dreams are shattered another queen without a king
what will out children become without proper guidance?
probably nothing so ain't the devil happy

ain't the devil happy

niggaz are in a state of nothingness
hopelessness lifelessness
if you're in range i hope you hear this
and try to change this 'cause it's disastrous
who gets the most loot who gets bust?
dollar bill y'all is the god we trust
the days blow by like dust
even men of steel rust
we're out here acting ridiculous
when only we can save us
mentally enslave us for little or nothin' kill our neighbors
animalistic caniballistic behavior
look to the sky for your savior
he won't save ya he didn't save your forefathers
why bothers brothers? you must discover
the power of self
know thyself or find thyself
hatin' thyself killin' thyself
while he collects the wealth that you sit back and murder for
ain't the devil happy",2

dirty down low profile
shoot up jams without the aid of lead projectiles

take more heads than santa claus at christmas
science misfits meet the rath of my wit
immediately following they go into a conniption fit
reach into my bag of darkness and spark this like an arsonist
blow up like a terrorist
i'm not a sexist don't have the power to be a racist
i'm a scientist and an activist
complex yeah simple like mixelplics

that's why they fear our jungle music
premier scratches in the j-u-n-g-l-e

chant my power to devour all the snakes and rats
extrasensory perception to avoid all traps
make a joyful noise unto the lord
in the sanctuary of your caves white kids press record
as my mystic music spread from sea to galaxy
it's inevitable you can't stop me
try to carbon copy but it always comes out sloppy
you can't outrap me you can't outrock me
like the dreads on my head you try to lock me
down underground but i bounce to the jungle
melodies that flows like the breeze
through the trees like my forefathers command the wind and seas
with my jungle music
premier does his thing
unga bunga binga
sound warrior i'll take your head more than a rap singer
enlightener with the mitre
make the forces of my nature smite ya
over the airwaves powers are released
holy music destroy the savage beast
i'll beat the devil like a niyabini drummer
beasts his drum this beat will drum through the summer
try to hold us back with all the strength you can muster

heard before he got ambushed you'll get ambushed

your dog is bound to lose and have a funeral
you can call landlords injects on my rent checks
bug man is back you project people better watch their necks
spittin' flim-flam rappers still smokin' crack

shark man? chuckling
judging from his appearance that's the most appropriate

intro two mr gerbik

moaning growling
yes you have met the dangerous 208 year-old uncle of dr octagon
i myself mr gerbik half-shark half-man skin like alligator
carrying a dead walrus check it

verse one mr gerbik

with my white eyes gray hair face is sky-blue yellow
sideburns react my skin is colored lilac
my skin turn orange and green in the limousine
people think i'm mixed with shark drinking gasoline
underwater i breathe and let loose on my sleeve
walking down hollywood boulevard with a credit card
three alligators behind me feel my skin is hard
transvestites and people watch space parasites
i left his head in the store legs in the street
body in wilcox with blood dripping off my feet
lapd through gray clouds couldn't see me
i first turned rainbow closed my eyes watch my brain glow
people got scared and ranned away they think i'm weird
i was born this way halfsharkalligator
is he weird??

chorus mr gerbik singing

half-shark-alligator-half-man
half man half shark
half-shark-alligator-half-man
half man half shark

verse two mr gerbik

my vomit fluctuates covers your skull like protoplasm
lightning bugs turn pink on my tongue catches spasms
green elephants i battle streets with a zebra
my mechanism is more than dionne's psychic voodoo
african beads snake skins cold script through you my medical passes
you can't see with greedy glasses
carbon dioxide pour right through 'em with gases
my description dinosaur
i was made half-shark-half-man my skin is like razor blades
seven-oh-seven mr gerbik
verbally no one change my thoughts animals fly from philly
my appetites more big it's time for wildebeests
adjust my skulls seven eyes switch hydraulic scribbles
and shrimps mack gorillas like a pimp
half-shark-alligator-man

verse three mr gerbik

in my real world orangutans dance for thanksgiving
with skeleton bones and skunk tails is my mission
holding backward raps to all my power packs
baboons clap and girl horses wanna hit the sack
we're too bold for ocean water monkeys sniffin ice
contact jupiter pools martians bring my rice
i'm out flyin' with purple capes in the twilight
ooh ooh ooh tonight's the night
my oxygen region's new york to california
half shark alligator half man

outro pbs nature

it takes a supreme feat of strength to swim through
the water plows while dragging two hundred and
fifty pounds on your back the crocodile's teeth
are designed to seize and hold not to cut through
skin during all the hours the somber lay in the water
but are unable to penetrate the deer's tough hide
the crocodiles make a few token objections but in the
end give up the struggle",2
17,"dr octagon paramedic focus on the east

0,"lord it's so hard living this life
a constant struggle each and every day
some wonder why i'd rather die
than to continue living this way

many are blind and cannot find
the truth 'cause no one seems to really know
but i won't accept that this is how it's gonna be
devil ya got ta let me and my people go

'cause i wanna be free
completely free
lord won't you please come and save me
i wanna be free",2
1,"let me get a chop at this lumber
niggas from da down underground are hangin' around the a-town
lookin' for a come up workin' from 9 to 5
just to get some change so t-mo can stay alive

not greedy or living' lavish yet but you can bet that when i do
nobody from my crew will i forget
if i start to get large and come up on some change
i won't change everybody know they down

it's not the same everyday life can be different
these laws got me ready to ball 'cause i fall a victim
so i still be slanging them fat pillows
to make 'em meet each and every day as i comb my city streets

sometimes i wish i never had been apart of this mess
'cause the system got us fucked up
it put us to the test women and men if you black you in
food for the soul listen to what i tell you it don't matter

young or old it's time we loc' up and do like we suppose
we killin' each other over this bullshit and some clothes
we're trapped off in this world and society with no place else to go
so how you feel?

frustrated irritated sometimes i don't know myself i be too numb
to feel something sometimes so i dig deep
go get in the cherokee let my mind fly free into the wilderness
so i can get this shit off my mind

that's why i be smokin' that dank sometimes it keeps me from snappin'
keeps me calm keeps my mind open keeps me fond of what i gots to do
off in the studio to get my old burd back on her feet
and my little bro in statesboro

and my little cuz mark twain all my folks that hang with me
when i was out in the trap or when i was goin'
thru one of our episodes only god knows
what i go thru so i get down

on my knees sometimes i come home too high to pray
but i get on my bed lay on my back and meditate anyway
in the ceilings the four walls it's like cell therapy
i got nothing to do but write about my l-i-f-e put it down on paper
so what you feel?

i live for today motherfuck another hour it might be sour
never know my day so i'm prayin' in the shower
look up and thank the lord for forgiveness a witness to bad
i'm lookin' for good in the southwest god bless my neighborhood

it's people killin' in da street to eat
surviving the day is the only goat that i set
just to make it home i'm not alone
someone's out to get me when i haven't done shit wrong

my head felt swoll mista couldn't see past my mouth
what route did you take man
caught me by that loops of my pants
got me on the curb lettin' tha traffic pass me by
no questions i said nothing

lookin' for tha mutant to be buckin' the law
naw man gipp show him my shit
close my mouth then i dip
see to me g is a person who understand tha plan
can't make no moves when you in tha hands of tha man

they got some new suites down peachtree
left wing for tha feds right wing for tha hardheads
makin' more deals than buddy folks made with hartsfield
somebody don't want my face in tha place for 96 shit's slick

got me clean lookin' fresh dogs be scratchin' at my chest
under the order of who? guess who ain't non-iller than miller
wanna 1 2 your ass no more life what you gave was tha past
cuz ain't no future wanna millicamp your case
disgrace your face make it seem to be safe
but ain't no place to run

sometimes i don't even know how i'm gon' eat
'bout twenty dollars away from being on the street
shit you might see a nigga on tv
but hell it's almost like i'm rappin' for free

that little money be gonegot dammit i'm gone
gotta help keep the heat and tights on
it would be nice to have mo' but i kinda like being poor
at least i know what my friends here for

i wanna lie to you sometimes but i can't
i wanna tell you that it's all good but it ain't
it's nigga's hurtin' and uncertain about if they gon' make it or not
that's why we got nigga's killing

feeling like they coming up off a little dope they sold
you can get some gold but we won't make it as a whole
'cause without you there'd be no me
and without no unity there will never be any happiness

you could smoke a pound of sess
and it still won't relieve yo' stress
god bless my thought process

the thought process
now as an outkast i was born wasn't warned of the harm
that would come to meet me like met life but yet life
done sent me through a lot of up's and down like it ain't nothing'
like elevators but i ain't the one that's pushin' the buttons

i got off at the 13th floor when they told me that it wasn't one
they said it skipped from 12 to 14
still smoking still drinking
no i'm sittin' on the lincoln 4 am thinkin'
that in reality the world is like a ball full of playas
we trapped off in this maze with walls made of layers

and only prayers is the tightest game that you can have
the devil's takin' a swing that might explain the broken glass
but my crystal ball see the pistol fall to the wayside
nobody would die in cops and robbers when we used to play right

huh the only thang we feared was williams wayne
never though about hittin' licks or slangin' caine
did not think i'd be the one to give in to abortion
label me murder because my ass is scorchin'

hot from the glock that sits under my seat
yeah it's real fucked up that my floks come to get me
and it's like dat
yeahand it's like dem",2

me and my family moved in our apartment complex
a gate with the serial code was put up next
they claim that this community is so drug free
but it don't look that way to me

'cause i can see the young bloods hangin' out at the store
24/7 junkies lookin' for a hit of the blow it's powerful
oh you know what else they tryin' to do make a curfew 
especially for me and you the traces of the new

world order time is gettin' shorter 
if we don't get prepared people this gon' be a slaughter
my mind won't allow me to not be curious
my folk don't understand so they don't take it serious

but every now and then
i wonder if the gate was put up
to keep crime out or to keep our ass in

who's that peekin' in my window

listen up little nigga i'm talkin' to you

everyday on the average 'bout 4 or 5
i'm lucky to be alive at sunrise
now i realize the cost after i lost 
my best friend bean i recognize as a king
who am i to tell you to stop smokin'

under attack loc up folks they in the hood

got an eye on every move i make 
open your face to info you ain't know cause it's kept low 
how the new world plan
reeks the planet without the black man

so what's your angle try to separate me from the 
blood is disrespect like comin' in my home and not
wipin' your feet on tha rug the citron absolut 
has got me buckin' no hang with no phony
lookout for the man with tha mask and the white pony
on my back are bills stayin' off my toes always on my heels

insane plain soldiers comin' in the dark by plane
to enforce the new system by reign
tag my skin with your computer chip
run your hand over the scanner to buy you dish now
no more fishin' for your fish

thanksgiving didn't give
so what should i hope for
i keep on looking fo job
but job seems not to like me

somebody just fill they christmas list
off me and tha family and damn i just miss them
felt like i've been raped
a figures been through my drawers
always read tha times in between tha black
spent my summers in that country
so i consider myself a jack

some left this world by putting bullets in they head
but little johnnie across the street hung hisself from his bunk-bed
had to go to court in tha mornin'
nothing hard about it
my little partner was just scared
how scared gipp that scared

when i was b-gee used to think i couldn't be hit
none of my homies carried guns
all i had was a stick
coming out hard was the way from day one
one of the smallest muthafuckers in the crew
but you knew and feel the type of niggas that kill
be the ones that's out to prove something
to them other niggers 'cause they already know the outcome

what's going down at the party
so many fine hoes nobody knows why
we buck i guess we up in a rut
looking for but at the same time
up in the flame supporting girls up in the game
out to get a piece of what the system
has designed black folks to struggle for
so i bust so much to deal with

can't feel what's real from fake
for my sake i stay close to home
so them crackers don't take and
never give back to my hood
in desperate need of change
be this way to rearrange it to be fit me

remember me from way back in the days
lived right around the corner from benjamin mays
i'm amazed that we made it this far
a po' black family is all that we are

wishing upon a star for a trace of happiness
my mama do her best but she ain't making no progress
maybe it's a test that we all gotta pass
my situations making me grow too fast

i took on the responsibility of daddy

makin sho' it marinate
and not go out the other ear

couldn't lift a spoon to my skull

god is good god is kind mimmicin' her taught me how to say mine

shut-up you old ungrateful ass nigga she trying to help yo' ass
i wasn't ready to eat yet but i enjoyed the dinner she said i'm glad
slid down my esophagus wit ease even though she have this skin disease
that won't allow me to gain weight do my own eyes deceive me

guess who took me in before i started drivin this benz
again &amp again told me not to and when i did
guess who beat the dog shit outta me kid
my momma didn't play shiiit i had to pick the switches
you guess who

fuck that shit
i'm through with that shit

my moma destination unknown went out on her own
she was barely even grown and became my moma
i never knew my dad so even when the times got bad
i was glad cause i had my moma

for so long she had to be strong
i know at certain times she was wrong
but she still my moma it still amaze me
the lord had to help her raise me judging from the way i used to be

my moma the biggest player that i know i love her so
hell everything i got i owe to my moma
thank you for caring thank you for sharing yo' luv
i guess that was yo' way of preparing

yo' son to be the one and not the two
to make you and my daddy's dream come true
but what a surprise a car wreck left you paralyzed
the sheet was pulled over yo' eyes when the doctor advised

the family that you might not ever talk again
but you talkin' so i know that you gon' walk again
but take yo time guess who's the inspiration for the rhyme
my moma

who was tha first to hold you in some arms
tha first to change your diaper when your stomach wasn't calm
your moma wit that drama brought you into this world
from a world of down under

i wonder how she know when i was lying when i was telling the truth
with the proof she would explain how i've been skipping school
with that boys putting wholes on my back with the same belt
around my waist that held my panst up

takin' back only got you closer to southern bell
got your forehead swell
i swear she knew when it was real or when it was fake like clampetts
with dreads and if i couldn't handle a situation then i fled

behind closed doors i froze in garnett holes i rose
who that hell got my bond
standing in front of that two-inch glass
a woman ready to hand the cash over for her son
my mama

sometimes we get it on i know at times i'm wrong
lookin' into my eyes just to let me know she tried is enough for me
i'm callin' a truce it seems we more like brother and sister
even though she pay the bills with the mister

brought me home in '72 and gave me all she had
'cause i was left at birth she knew it could work
since she gave me the first chance my song and dance
pearl my world what would i do without her spark

probably be on the street wit nothin' to eat but i got a happy home
ever since my first day it's heaven sent now i know 
what it's meant when i say
i appreciate what you've done and what you do your only son
guess who???

the only one that cares for real guess who
and really understands how i feel guess who
help me over come my fears guess who
and never left me through the years guess who

so i dedicate this song to you guess who
for all that you brought me through guess who

that will love me like my mother guess who",2

still fighting for our spirit and mind
can't stop fighting for our spirit and mind

multiple stab wounds sticin' thru in the ol' school
cutlass supreme thirty-five cents to my name and that's fo' a blunt man
the way thangs goin' today i might as well be dead so dread
the voices on the radio got me steamed
can't put a smile on my face 'cause my pockets ain't straight
at least not the way i want 'em to be
early as phuckk eight fifty-one
last night i barely got some z's

sleepuh i can't ol' burd in the next room havin' nightmares
it sound like wind blowin' when she weep speak
i can't i'm tired on the way to the slave camp
i utter very little words i'm thinkin' about a ciggy i snatched
from the jaws of death a sack of crumbled herb

rollin' down main street east point i swerve
campbelton rd southside
eight fify-five jacket at bus top standin' sweatin' but i ain't smilin
outside it's twenty below fool i'm ridin' to the liquor store
closed that's right i go hotta at this beeso i know
who work at the texaco gas station

pacin' back down memory lane
feelin' strange can't explain so bare wit me pleae
thru this green light i sees
that tramp that gave me herpes wreck wham crash stumblin'

jumps out the ride empty the glock fo' five dead
woke up handcuffed inside grady
tagged with an i-u-d intoxicated una dank
i took two swiggs outts my deuce-deuce old e
now stephen k-i-n-g had the story all wrong
blood last five points i'm gone

as individuals and as a people we are at war
but the majority of my side got they eyes open wide
but still don't recognize what we fighting for
i guess that's what i'm writing for
to try to shed some light
but we been in the darkness for so long don't know right from wrong
y'all scared to come near it
you ignore the voice in your head when you hear it

the enemy is after yo' spirit but you think it's all in yo' mind
you'll find a lot of the reason we behind
is because the system is designed to keep our third eyes blind
but not blind in the sense that our other two eyes can't see
you just end up investing quality time in places you don't even neeed to be

we don't even know who we are but the answer ain't far
matter of fact its right up under our nose
but the system taught us to keep that book closed
see the reason why he gotta lie and deceive
is so that we won't act accordingly
to get the blessings we suppose to receive

yeah it's true uncle sam wants you to be a devil too
see he's jealous because his skin is a curse but what's worse
is if i put it in a verse y'all listen to some bullshit first
we ain't natural born killas we are a spiritual people
god's chosen few
think about the slave trade
when they had boats with thousands of us on board
and we still was praising the lord

now you ready to die over a coat a necklace round your throat
that's bullshit
black people ya'll better realize we losin you better fight and die
if you got to get yo' spirit and mind back and we got to do it together
goodie mob means the good die mostly over bullshit
you take away one o and it will let you know
god is every man of blackness
the lord has spoken thru me and the g-mo-b

seems like we're fighting for our spirit and mind
they got us fighting for our spirit and mind
still fighting for our spirit and mind
can't stop fighting for our spirit and mind",2

a man sleeping on pavement

stacking away my extra for a engine for tha hog
dropping a point from the east
from a location out tha trees

revenge is best served when cold by those
who feel no guilt

always go with your first instinct because
i don't make the rules

victims rarely get a chance to think twice

as he laid in the final resting place
he had such a peaceful expression in his face
my visions blurry from crying
but it aint hard to see that
at any time it coulda been me
it's about 90 degrees outside

but yet it felt like i'm froze
the ceremonies come to a close
i toss a rose but just can't seem to walk away yet
damn i done fucked around and got upset

but it aint nothing we can do
it's bigger than me and you
one day our time coming too
so aint no use in being sad
leaving here was probably the best gift he ever had
we should be glad

maybe his life was something
that he had to give to show me
that i need to be responsible about how i live
i won't complain about my pain

take away the bad and bring back

takin' a gun and pulled it on an innocent friend of mine

good thangs come to those that wait
took a los on church strait

done gee seen on i pray for you but i won't follow you to your end

i know of a place not too far away
that maybe you and i can both go someday
but i gotta make sure cause i ain't tryin' to stay here
don't y'all realize that the end is so near

but don't have fear 'cause you still got time
i hope you wanna come when i'm done with the rhyme
let me explain so you won't claim you didn't know
and you can make sure that this is where you wanna go

it's all about preparing yourself for the return
and a trip to your soul is the only way you'll learn
but if you choose not to go that ain't my concern
i guess in hell you'll just have to burn

verse one

back in the days i knew rap would never die
i used to listen to awesome-2 on whbi
i used to hear all kind of rap groups before sampling loops
rappers wore bell-bottom lee suits
me and kenny couldn't afford that
so we would go to the park when they was jammin' to hear rap
i used to listen till the cops broke it up
i always thought to myself damn why they fucked it up?
but never the less i was in love with the microphone
and it stayed that way until i left home
on the streets of new york now i'm free
but with freedom comes big responsibility
i used to walk around driven by the force
i remember how large super rhymes was when he fell off
i used to wonder about crews that used to rock
they were large but none of them could manage to stay on top

do you ever think about when you outta here?
record deal and video outta here?
mercedes benz and range rover outta here?
no doubt bdp is old school but we ain't goin' out

verse two

after livin' on the streets alone
some years went by i signed myself into a group home
i used to watch the show i dream of jeannie
and dreamt about when will i be large like whodini?
but i was messin' with graffiti on the subway
and gettin' chased by the cops almost everyday
i knew it had to bea better way see
so i would go to my room blast run dmc
around 1984 i left the group home again alone
still dreamin' about the microphone
gimme a chance man i know i can rock it
but i had to worry about puttin' money in my pocket
so when i reached the shelter i met my helper dj scott la rock
and we both loved hip-hop
i was takin' suckas out in the shelter system
yeah there was rappers in the shelter but i had to diss 'em
but all along my vision was never lost
i kept seeing all these rap groups fallin' off

do you ever think about when you're outta here?
fly girl and fresh gear outta here?
five-thousand dollar love seat outta here?
no doubt bdp is old school but we ain't goin' out

verse three

while i'm battling these rival crews
yes bdp would stay in the street news
some said all they wanna do is battle
they can't write a song so their careers won't last long
around this time i used to hang with ced gee
and dj scott la rock used to buy gold with eric b
i didn't meet rakim till later with scott
i remember we were jammin' at the rooftop
it used to irk me when these critics had opinions
scott would say just keep rappin' i'll keep spinnin'
we had a fucked up contract but we signed it
and dropped the hip-hop album criminal minded
we told the critics your opinions are bull
same time eric b and rakim dropped paid in full
hip-hop pioneers we didn't ask to be
but right then hip-hop changed drastically
people didn't wanna hear the old rap sound
we started samplin' beats by james brown
in the middle of doin' my philosophy
scott was killed and that shit got to me
but knowin' the laws of life and death
i knew his breath was one with my breath
i had nothin' left and it was scary
so i dropped by all means necessary
another hip-hop group that was a friend of me
was a revolution crew called public enemy
it takes a nation of millions to hold us back
these two albums set off consciousness in rap
but all along i'm still lookin' around

i'll smash your wanna-be ass in the deep dirt
black you'll come up dizzy sayin' how da fuck he do dat?
'cause you're yappin' like you can't be reached
if your name ain't arrested development well save your speech

stand clear don man a-talk
you can't stand where i stand you can't walk where i walk
watch out we run new york
police man come we bust him out the park
i know this for a fact you don't like how i act
you claim i'm sellin' crack but you be doin' that
i'd rather say see ya 'cause i would never be ya
be a officer? you wicked overseer
ya hotshot wanna get props and be a saviour
first show a little respect change your behavior
change your attitude change your plan
there could never really be justice on stolen land
are you really for peace and equality?
or when my car is hooked up you know you wanna follow me
your laws are minimal
'cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
this has got to cease
'cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police

woop-woop
that's the sound of da police
woop-woop
that's the sound of the beast

now here's a likkle truth open up your eye
while you're checking out the boom-bap check the exercise
take the word overseer like a sample
repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
overseer
overseer
overseer
overseer
officer officer officer officer
yeah officer from overseer
you need a little clarity?
check the similarity
the overseer rode around the plantation
the officer is off patrolling all the nation
the overseer could stop you what you're doing
the officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
the overseer had the right to get ill
and if you fought back the overseer had the right to kill
the officer has the right to arrest
and if you fight back to put a hole in your chest
woop they both ride horses
after 400 years i've got no choices
the police them have a little gun
so when i'm on the streets i walk around with a bigger one
woop-woop i hear it all day
just so they can run the light and be upon their way

yes indeed
woop-woop
that's the sound of da police
woop-woop
that's the sound of the beast

check out the message in a rough stylee
the real criminals are the c-o-p
you check for undercover and the one pd
but just a mere black man them want check me
them check out me car for it shine like the sun
but them jealous or them vexed 'cause them can't afford one
black people still slaves up till today
but the black police officer nah see it that way
him want a salary him want it
so he put on a badge and kill people for it
my grandfather had to deal with the cops
my great-grandfather dealt with the cops
my great grandfather had to deal with the cops
and then my great great great great when it's gonna stop?

for some reason we think we're free
so we'll never be
because we haven't recognized slavery
you're still a slave look at how you behave
debatin' on where and when and how and what massa gave
you wanna know how we screwed up from the beginning?
we accepted our opressor's religion
so in the case of slavery it ain't hard
because it's right in the eyes of their god
where is our god the god that represents us?
the god that looks like me the god that i can trust?
a god of peace and love not mass hysteria
i don't want a god that blesses america
i could never really vote for the devil
let me take you to a higher level


verse two

title take the title from the bible we can get there
rip the title from off the front of the bible god don't live there
too many inconsistencies too many mysteries
picture the pope and the vatican laughing and drinking and singing and
kissing me
i stand with god whether i'm paid or whether i'm cryin' broke
i like to ask these politicians would jesus vote?
the way we view god is a freakin' shame
church is to blame
we trust god but bomb hussein
we simply lovin' the scripture
same scripture that whipped 'cha
sooner it'll hit 'cha
religion's gettin' richer
with that european version of christ made into a picture
our society's gettin' sicker and sicker and sicker
like liquor we are god-intoxicated
not to the true god but the one the government created
the same governments tellin' people to vote
i pray to god because the people have lost hope
you either vote for the mumps or the measels
whether you vote for the lesser of two evils you vote for evil
politics and god are not equal
but the education if you don't guard is really lethal
people have more respect for a holy book
than they do for a cow on a meat hook
belivers of jesus be denouncing satan on every level
but every halloween they're dressin' like devils
i pray to you for the light you might give them
mother make them know that you're livin' with them
you begin them and end them in silence
frankly if they knew you they would understand violence
i pray to you for the pope and the vatican
have mercy mother 'cause i know that you're mad at them
the white jesus deceived us awhile ago
and pope julius the second paid michaelangelo
i know this happened in 1519 yet
this is the image we can't seem to forget
vote for god don't vote for the devil
let me take you to a higher level",2

rolling dice can help you or hurt you your virtue
is known when you quit 'cause you've hit your cash curfew
even if you have to get swift and swindle
it's as long as you with so close you're simple
i see people rolling dice with lives
telling lies and cutting close like knives
for a sandwich and selter so probablt sell the
clothes on they man's back for fame and wealth or
go with the next man's girl and hit the skins
get in his face and say yo we're best friends
scared of a tattle because his tail shake like a rattle
and then he'll kiss behind like a saddle
that'll be the reason why you'll bleed and grieve
ready to diss your own brother at breakneck speed
you roll the dice reall fast to get nice
but gotta be more precise
'cause i keep looking and you'll keep scheming
i'll start hooking and you'll be screaming
starting to tries in an alibi
cause you keep rolling snake eyes

yeah yeah yeah

the person you least expect to slit your neck
nine times out of every ten crimes is the prime suspect
it doesn't feel good when you can't trust blood
and your neighbor's the neighborhood hood
plotting the cut neck scam
you sleeping in the end you get swept cause you slept
yeah the dice get blown on so step back
snakes attack and move as fast as a cadillac
but if found in my circumference
the next day you'll pay to get your fronts fixed
rolling 11 is the opposite of heaven
it's craps so start revving to make tracks
once a snake you stay a snake
when you're small you took cookies but now you take the cake
and talk behind backs and switch facts
and tax and probably smoke cracks
cause one minute my crib you're all in it
the next day you wanna play self centered?
just because you're in with the fake guys
and you keep rolling snake eyes

yeah

i watch people roll dice in the jungle of concrete
with venom corrodes the streets
where girls get foul on their guys why? they're rolling snake eyes
where the guys get foul on their wives why? they're rolling snake eyes
false producers are telling lies why? they're rolling snake eyes
policemen are taking bribes why? they're rolling snake eyes
so here's the solution to the problem that lies ahead
shoot a motherfucking snake dead
for rolling snake eyes",2
1,"i'm just hangin' out
i'm just hangin' out

i'm mainly known for the rough raps
but kids steal my lyrics like hubcaps
and eat 'em like stacks of flapjacks like rugrats
hey and i get busy over unknown traps
while the next man flaps his lids like parkay
i'm skilled in the field so slide to the side
i make a rapper cry 'cause i can get some shuteye
while he's havin' hard times writin rhymes
so he gnaws on my metaphors and dines on my lines
which is the reason why i like to hang out and
hustle with my friends to get away from pens
and copiers so i'm corona bound
to check drew aka dr butcher and what's goin' down
and joe with the jetta enables us to get around town
he's a clown
other than that i'm with joe and burgles
watchin old black caesar flicks for kicks
jump in the wagoner we're outta here without an idea where
but usually we wind up there
i go over k-cut's block cause raw cuts is what he blends

check it and i like to hang out and hustle with my friends

yo i'm just hangin' out
with my friends

i'm just hangin' out

and i be up in mt vernon piecein with cl smooth and pete rock
makin' beats that's sharper than cleats
with my griffy grif from the cafe black pros
checkin' out videos
and i speak with my man rob leak
on the problems of the weak dumb and meek my man's deep
like the kid from the bridge named the rapper nas
me and che collect money in bars
and i run through discotheques like sound
royal rich is profound yellin' free james brown
we rush through up to the discotheque and
hustle up a storm in a swarm like we bought a farm
nobody can get with the whereabout
'cause we're out to shuffle they feet
without a shadow of a doubt
from flushing to the streets of new york in fact
freshly dipped off the wack but not to pan grack
in the apartment got plans for the night
everything's right takin' it light
preparin for the best tiffany's to be in
and everyday seems like a day from the weekend
the pool that never ends
yo the science is the powerhouse tonight baby
word i'm with that
always the powerhouse
nah but ain't nothin' at your house
i like my house
and i like to hang out and hustle with my friends

conversation continues",2
2,"we fight every night now that's not kosher
i reminisce with bliss of when we was closer
and wake up to be greeted by an argument again
you act like you're ten
so immature i try to concentrate on a cure
and keep lookin' at the front door
thinkin' if i were to evacuate
you'd probably be straighter than straight and wouldn't have so much hate
'cause you don't know the pain i feel when i see you smilin'
and when i roll up you start wilin'
so i front like everything's hunky-dory
but it's a whole different story
you don't like the fact that i'm me
i don't put on a show when it comes time for you to have company
and your friends don't understand your choice of man
they speak proper while my speech is from a gargabe can
but regardless you shouldn't have to be so raw
i'm lookin' at the front door

i'm lookin' at the front door
baby i'm lookin' at the front door
i'm lookin' at the front door

and when you're with your friends i glide to the side
until the spotlight is mine and never sabotage a good time
but when they're not around the fights commence
i'm the one you're against and it doesn't make sense
'cause i'm the one that you claim to love for life
but all i get is gray hairs and strife
and i can play some ole stuck-up rapper role
and get foul every time you lose control
but that's not my order of operations
so i should win an award for lots of patience
'cause that's all a fella can have
with a girl who's shootin' up his world like shaft
and i don't think that i can take it anymore
i'm lookin' at the front door

i'm lookin' at the front door
i'm lookin' at the front door
i'm lookin' at the front door

my friends always tell me how i'm lucky to possess
the best looking girl in the whole us
but every time you scream you blow your finesse
tryin' to dis the profess-
or twenty-four hours of acting sore
sometimes i wish you'd come down with lockjaw
so i don't have to take in the breakin'
you treat me like a burnt piece of bacon
it seems like just two years
back when we were bonded and not pierced
but now i keep itchin' to jet
sitting' in the chair just to stare set
to sprint
yo sweetheart you better take a hint
i say it now like i said it before
i'm lookin' at the front door

i'm lookin' at the front door
i'm lookin' at the front door
i'm lookin' at the front door",2

nine prints and diss a meantimes where the sun don't shine

you got kicked in the ass by the man with the eyes of glass
slide from me you money kicking the dull crap
i'll make your skull snap seeing me all at
in this here field my foot equals yield
your brain is simple and reveal while mine is sealed
coming up with the archeological finds
funk drums allow me to spark you with rhymes
the mic's my instrument my skills are infinite catch a hint from it
'cause it's the large professor

while you was doing the butt i was putting game down
you frowned before now you wear the same frown
just as long as the buck i sit when i think
i couldn't care less who was jelling the profess-or
sir scratch and k-cut the main source
back to break more atoms of course
with the beat no more melodious votes i surprise folks
i'm as sharp as a toothpick come and watch the youth kick
the game so tough cause the shine i'll scuff
busting the fluff 'cause i'm just that tough
the mic's my instrument my skills are infinite catch a hint from it
'cause it's the large professor

i stomp supposed comp like a posse
brothers try to squash me so i speak harshly
on the constant truth of the main source crew
i peruse the place just to see what i can do
to stupid mc's whose rhymes sound fabricated
heads get deflated when the professor's untranslated
style gets everyday play
brothers on the butters can't flip the parkay
their mouths are sealed like zip-loc bags
fake like wrestling and small like frags
the mic's my instrument my skills are infinite catch a hint from it
'cause it's the large professor

finessing the songs like this babblists get bust with the quickness
baby hit the mist
you want to feel hard times then friend say your rhymes
the results will be about 10 volts in your mind
i'll electrify your brain is hollow like a tunnel
i squeeze out doubt like a funnel
i'm the ms rep on the microphone
if i say what you don't like go home
that's why the places i play stay packed
you like what i say and you always come back
the mic's my instrument my skills are infinite catch a hint from it
'cause it's the large professor",2
4,"aww shit another young brother hit
i better go over my man's crib and get the pump
'cause to the cops shootin brothers is like playin' baseball
and they're never in a slump
i guess when they shoot up a crew it's a grand slam
and when it's one it's a home run
but i'ma be ready with a wild pitch
my finger got a bad twitch plus i'm on the switch
aide and step up to the batter's box
fuck red and white i got on black sox
but let him shoot a person from the white sox
what's the call? foul ball
babe ruth woulda made a good cop but he didn't
instead he was a bigot dig it
my life is valuable and i protect it like a gem
instead of cops gettin' me i'm goin' out shootin them
and let 'em cough up blood like phlegm
it's grim but dead is my antonym
and legally they can't take a fall
yo check it out it's just a friendly game of baseball

rbi - real bad injury
but don't get happy you're in jail for a century
just as bad as bein shot in the groin
to see who'll shoot ya they'll flip a coin
and watch him run for the stretch
but you don't know the man is at home waitin to make the catch
so the outfielder guns you down
you're out off to the dugout underground
i know a cop that's savage his pockets stay green like cabbage
'cause he has a good batting average
no questions just pulls out the flamer
and his excuses get lamer
once a brother tried to take a leave
but they shot him in his face sayin' he was tryin' to steal a base
and people watch the news for coverage on the game
hmm and got the nerve to complain
they need to get themselves a front row seat
or sink a baseline for a beat
'cause television just ain't designed for precision y'all
it's just a friendly game of baseball

a kid caught on but i don't know where the brother went
the umpires are the government
i guess they took him out the game and replace him with a pinch-hitter
in the scam he was a quitter
so the cops usually torment i mean tournament
win 'em i was sayin'
you can't let the umpires hear ya speak and battle
like the other kid you won't be playin'
'cause they'll beat you till your ass drop
a walking gun with a shell in his hand is their mascot
and when they walk around let it be known to step lightly
the bases are loaded
my man got out from three strikes in the skull
but the knife he was carrying was dull
instead of innings we have endings
what a fine way to win things
and hot-dog vendors have fun
sellin you the cat rat and dog on a bun
and when you ask what is all of this called?
it's just a friendly game of baseball",2
6,"peace piece of what?
you can't mean p-e-a-c-e
'cause i've seen people on the streets
shoot the next man and turn around and say peace
but that's leaving people in pieces
it's not what the meaning of peace is
to me it means the absence of all confusion
not the oozing and brusing
that we're all so accumstomed to
your friend got beef? i'll bust him too
what a brother from a certain way of life explained to me once dunce
he didn't realize the fact that
he and myself were brothers on the same rope
now last month he got hemmed up huh that's all she wrote
so i can get up where she left the exclamation
looking for an explanation
little kids think that peace is a word that you use to sound down
and i frown
cause that's what i was told at eaight years old
and now i'm trying to break the mold
so stop the dominoes
i think it's about time that everyone knows

the incorrect usage of the word peace has got to cease
stop frontin stop frontin stop frontin like you know what i'm saying
and on that note i'll leave you with this",2
7,"if something is yours by right
then fight for it or shut up

si a que estamos con main source con el profesor grande
sir skratch and k-cut y vamos a late los rappers
y no puede en casa

rappers can dance sing and shake their thing at the same time
but can't rhyme
they probably think that as long as they gettin paid
they can sleep in the shade but they'll fall like a cascade
while i drop skills over drum fills
they'll try to pick up some and still sound slum
cause they didn't learn the fundamentals
at this and i insist that they get dissed
for fraud their weak rap tunes keep me bored
sword due to the type of bullshit they record
hey and i make em concentrate on the songs i create
and kids can't wait to get they fork knife and plate
so they can chew what i serve with the nerve
to call themselves real but i know the deal
so i just place all the cards on the trap
tell them to cut the crap now let's rap

si a que estan allegrando de esos rapid que
sepatan muy grande que no sabe lo dice haciendo
por no se con fat pero el profesor el es sabo
de casiendo y entien la musica muy buena
y cucata estaba con grande como eso
espendejos sepatan muy grande por alli
y sir skratch and k-cut ellos que estaba dj
muy bueno con sabo por diciendo

now all you rap clowns let's go the seven rounds
and put down your imaginary frown
or take it to the streets with multiple beats
get as loose as you want flaunt no beeps
this time when you rhyme it won't be for a rock show
it'll be on the block so
we can work like strainers or filters
and find out all remainders and the best builders
cause so many mc's get star struck
get on stage and find out that they're washed up
cause some new jack took em out
but they was sleepin so what's the surprised look about
it ain't hard to tell that your records sell
because your rhymes smell and people scared
of a brother that drop the bombshell
so to show and prove the fact it's important that you
come and show your tactics asap let's rap

ah que estamos hablando hora de los rapid que
setamos bien de lo calle y que estan de la
tando de campias un cancione no sabe por
haciendo pero que yo sabe que main source
ellos son yan de pierdegre quien no en calle
que es la musica por la calle pierde ok

okay

terror on wax large professor k-cut and sir skratch
kickin it to kids that can't latch
on to the meaning of a real rap song
just producing corn i like to warn
we build it up dis far without sellin out
and still got clout
so you continue to sell and be a sap
and when you're ready to snapback i tell you
let's rap

si porque la esas estamos pidando

8,"man i had soul since i was negative three months old
when it came to getting down i was bold
kicking steps until you had to put my ass in a choke hold
and damn near wouldn't fold
check the picture with the apple jack hat
my father even taught me how to skat
so i developed the skat into what we call rap
and get nasty at that
getting loose is not a problem it's getting back together
i pull girls like a lever i get tired
bring the coffee to my lips and watch the large professor do backflips

he got so much soul he don't need no music [x4]

i possess skills in the field of rapping
so get down 'cause i make it happen
pop with a limp low pro pimp
i make other mc's mope
cause their skills ain't developed like negatives
throughout the years i've done mega kids
so don't fix your mouth you say i can't handle
i got more sole than a sandle
cooler than a liter of digital soundproof
i raise the roof ain't that the truth
got money in the bank baby pah i'm a star

he got so much soul he don't need no music [x4]

i rip rappers up like a card
yo large professor i want to battle
man you're sorry
i'm part of the main source
and we eat dj's and mc's as the main course
for dinner lunch brunch you better break fast
'cause i'll eat your whole bunch
or crew your girl's stuck to me like glue
'cause i kick it like a class of kung fu
i use a pick in my hair without force
you use a lawn mower you got peat moss
growing on your dome that's why you're so dumb
i'll eat you like a plum

10,"we all know roger roger lives in queens
brooklyn manhattan the bronx and he fiends
for knowledge and people try to diss him because of that
surrounded by the ghetto plus the fact that the brother's black
but roger gets high - grades on tests
he smokes - brain cells to rest
but brothers jel on him because he has a goal
and gold awards hanging all off the brain pain
behold roger doesn't fight his brain is his left and his right
but if tainted he just might
so all you brothers flying with a broken wing
watch roger do his thing

roger graduated from high school
but didn't advance or enhance no scholarship cool
flip he did not he got a job at a parking lot
teased because he wasn't making g's at a crack spot
he started meeting the people with the high ranks
attained a job as a manager at a bank
roger started rolling a benz
had a bunch of rich friends and that's where his ghetto life ends
he rolls around the projects he lived in once in a while
sees the brothers that was jelling and cracks a smile
they have rings but he has a ring of keys
and d's and now my man roger is worth g's
he doesn't have to rap or sing
he has to think so watch roger do his thing

roger has diamonds like i have lyrics
always in good spirits and money's never made
its hip to be suqare is roger's main motto
cash coming out of his ass like he hit lotto
he reminices on all the bad years
remembers his fear and smiles ear to ear
counts a knot and goes to ?backa jaluts? to eat
hogo boss on his feet smelling sweet
gucci frames and all the high class names
stetson suit clean on the scene laying down game
you can't cramp his style he's as sharp as the tip of a nail file
you're going to fail child
check him out while he plays with his ring
watch roger do his thing

roger's a cassanova now he's swimming in women
a symbol in sex messing with their intellects
throws parties every week in his happy home
out on the island and stays smiling alone
that's his style macking skins and laying girls like towels
not acting wild
question roger's life seems complete right?
that's what an education can and might do
it may sound corny but it's true
roger does his thing and so can you
so get your head out the sling
and watch roger do his thing hit it

verse five ghostface killah

check out my beaver baby blue glock in the safe

we hold a belt son that's my word
spot a rapper run him down throw him out in the third yo check it
i think like the man behind a register
evergreen smokin' estates rhyme and power made me treasurer
with third down six to go flash his strobe lights
i'm open rza hit me off lovely and i love him
with root beer thoughts here's a tennis court
for your birthday the babyface of rap politic with sade
avenging eagle crooks rock the w in spiegel books
anheuser busch kings came through and stopped your whole jooks
spitfire kangols watch tony train a gang of hoes
painful like hearing the news like when your man go
ends blow windy at times watch the room sheisty girl
love to sit out this song now watch your water break

it's like this ninety-seven
aight my niggaz and my niggarettes
let's do it like this
i'm a-rub your ass in the moonshine
let's take it back to seventy-nine

inspectah deck
i bomb atomically socrates' philosophies
and hypotheses can't define how i be droppin' these
mockeries lyrically perform armed robbery
flee with the lottery possibly they spotted me
battle-scarred shogun explosion when my pen hits
tremendous ultra-violet shine blind forensics
i inspect view through the future see millennium
killa beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
shacklin' the masses with drastic rap tactics
graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
black wu jackets queen beez ease the guns in
rumble wit' patrolmen tear gas laced the function
heads by the score take flight incite a war
chicks hit the floor diehard fans demand more
behold the bold soldier control the globe slowly
proceeds to blow swingin' swords like shinobi
stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
wu got it locked performin' live on you hottest block

method man
as the world turn i spread like germs
bless the globe with the pestilence da hard-headed never learn
it's my testament to those burned
play my position in the game of life standing firm
on foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
transform into the ghostrider a six-pack
in a streetcar named desire who got my back?
in the line of fire holdin' back what?
my people if you wit' me where the fuck you at?
niggaz is strapped and they tryin' a twist my beer cap
it's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
herb got my wig fried like a bad perm what the blood-
clot we smoke pot and blow spots
you wanna think twice i think not
da iron lung ain't got ta tell you where it's coming from
guns of navarrone tearin' up your battle zone rip through your slums

cappadonna
i twist darts from the heart tried and true
loot my voice on the lp my team is on to slang rocks
certified chatterbox vocabulary 'donna talking
tell your story walking
take cover kid what? run for your brother kid
run for your team and your six can't rhyme groupies
so i can squeeze with the advantage
and get wasted my deadly notes reigns supreme your fort is basic
compared to mine
domino effect arts and crafts
paragraphs contain cyanide take a free ride
on my dart i got the fashion catalogues
for all y'all to all praise to the gods

ol dirty bastard
the saga continues
wu-tang wu-tang

u-god
olympic torch flamin' we burn so sweet
the thrill of victory the agony defeat
we crush slow flamin' deluxe slow
for- judgement day cometh conquer it's war
allow us to escape hell glow spinnin' bomb
pocket full of shells out the sky golden arms
tune spit the shit immortal combat sound
the fake false step make the blood stain the ground
a jungle junkie vigilante tantrum
a death kiss cap off squeeze another anthem
hold it for ransom tranquilised with anesthetics
my orchestra graceful music ballerinas
my music sicily rich california smell
an axekiller adventure paint a picture well
i sing a song from sing-sing sippin' on ginseng
righteous wax chaperone rotating ring-king

rza
watch for the wooden soldiers c-cypher punks couldn't hold us
a thousand men rushing in not one nigga was sober
perpendicular to the square we stand bold like flare
escape from your dragon's lair--in particular
my beats travel like a vortex
through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
enter-through-your-right-ventricle-clog-up your bloodstream high terminal
like grand central station program fat baselines on novation
getting drunk like a fuck i'm duckin five-year probation

gza
war of the masses the outcome disastrous
many of the victims' families save they ashes
a million names on walls engraved in plaques
those who went back received penalties for their acts
another heart is torn as close ones gone
those who stray niggaz get slayed on the song

masta killa
the track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
and leaks sounds that's heard
ninety-three million miles away from came one
to represent the nation this is a gathering
of the masses that come to pay respects to the wu-tang clan
as we engage in battle
the crowd now screams in rage
the high chief jamel-ah-rief takes the stage
light is provided through sparks of energy
from the mind that travels in rhyme form
giving sight to the blind
the dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
death only one can save shell from
this relentless attack of the track spares none

ghostface killah
yo yo yo fuck that look at all these crab niggaz laid back
lampin' like them gray and black pumas on my man's rack
codeine was forced in your drink you had a navy dream
salamander fiend bitches never heard you scream
you two-faces scum of the slum i got your whole body numb
blowing like shalamar in eighty-one
sound convincin' thousand dollar court by convention
hands like sonny liston get fly permission
hold tha fuck up allah fasten your wig bad luck
i humiliate separate the english from the dutch
it's me black noble drew ali came in threes
we like the genovese is that so? caesar needs the greens
it's earth ninety-three million miles from the first
rough turbulence the waveburst split the megahertz

raekwon
aiyyo dat's amazing gun in your mouth talk verbal foul hawk
connect thoughts to make my man shai walk
swift notarizer wu-tang all up in the high-riser
new york gank adviser world tranquilizer
just the dosage delegate my clan with explosives
while my pen blow lines ferocious
mediterranean see ya the number one traffic sit down the beat god
then delegate the god to see god
the swift chancellor flex the white-gold tarantula
track truck diesel play the weed god substantiala

verse one rza

fusion of the five elements to search for the higher intelligence
women walk around celibate livin' irrelevant
the most benelovent king communicatin through your dreams
mental pictures been painted allah's heard and seen
everywhere throughout your surroundin atmosphere
troposphere thermosphere stratosphere
can you imagine from one single idea everything appeared here
understanding makes my truth crystal clear
innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenemants
eighty-five percent tenants depend on welfare recipients
stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp
at night i walk through third eye is bright as a street lamp
electric microbes robotic probes
taking telescope pictures of globe babies getting pierced with microchips
stuffed inside their earlobes then examined
blood contaminated vaccinated lives fabricated
exaggerated authorization food and drug administration
testin poison in prison population
my occupation to stop the innauguration of satan
some claim that it was reagan so i come to slay men
like bartholemew cause every particle is physical article
was diabolical to the last visible molecule
a space night like rom consume planets like unicron
blasting photon bombs from the arm like galvatron

verse two u-god

united nations gun fire style patient
formulatin rap plural acapella occupation
conquer land like napoleon military bomb fest
we want sanitary food planetary conquest
thug peoples on some hardco' body shit
get your shit together 'fore the fuck illuminati hit
dreams is free in escape of sleep
for a fool peep jewels keep tools for tough time
the rule of rough mind elevate stay behind
the sun gotta shine keep on cremate
the whole babylon times up move on
kings on your pawn checkmate no fakes
opposed through the gate case closed
things get froze when it comes time chosen ones
were holding guns we take flight with no fright
and attack never fear cause our words is clear
what's been done can't be undone son we can't care
cause the last days and times are surely here
snakes and flakes get blown by the rightous ones
divine minds bind we unified as one
half of black hope we half broke smoke a bowl of weed shit
our everlastin answers stay flyin over egypt

chorus tekitha

for you to defeat the gods
impossible you can never defeat
the gods impossible
for you to defeat the gods

verse three ghostface killah

call an ambulance jamie been shot word to kemit
don't go son nigga you my motherfuckin heart
stay still son don't move just think about keeba
she'll be three in january your young god needs you
the ambulance is taking too long
everybody get the fuck back excuse me bitch gimme your jack

blood comin' out his mouth he bleedin badly
nah jamie don't start that shit
keep your head up if you escape hell we gettin' fucked up
when we was eight we went to bat day to see the yanks
in sixty-nine his father and mines they robbed banks
he pointed to the charm on his neck
with his last bit of energy left told me rock it with respect
i opened it seen the god holdin' his kids
photogenic tears just burst out my wig
plus he dropped one oh shit here come his old earth
with no shoes on screamin holdin' her breasts with a gown on
she fell and then lightly touched his jaw kissed him
rubbed his hair turned around the ambulance was there
plus the blue coats officer lough took it as a joke
weeks ago he strip-searched the god and gave him back his coke
bitches yellin' beenie man swung on helen
in the back of a cop car dirty tarts are tellin'
but suddenly a chill came through it was weird
felt like my man was cast out my heaven now we share
laid on the stretcher blood on his wally's like ketchup
deep like the full assassination with a sketch of it
it can't be from yohoo to lee's
second grade humped the teachers about to leave
finally this closed chapter comes to an end
he was announced pronounced dead y'all at twelve ten

outro raekwon and tekitha

now what my man is trying to tell y'all
is that across the whole globe you can never
the murder rates is increasin and we decreasin you can never
so at the same time when you play with guns

lot of knowledge on the microphone when i speak
rabbit mc's i love to eat

i'm comin' way too real and i'm blowin' your mind
i'm tearin shit up i won't let up you need to get up
and out and on the floor 'cause i'm fed up
with rhymes and words that's weak that's wack absurd
pollutin the airwaves too often heard
i come through with the rhymes so true blue with the rhymes
i eat you with the rhymes and on and on and in time i'm
movin with the smooth the groove that some consider dangerous
and you're playin' this i ain't new to this

{scratching}

yeah it's a scarface groove

paris is the name and i'm here to get sick
i mean i'm stronger than a tiger and i'm down with the click
while makin' sure my song is deffer with an 808 kick
and now you know it i'm a poet and i'm harder than a brick
i makin' over 3 g's a day and you say
that mad's cuttin' like a blade over sucker dj
start shinin all the time that i'ma standin on stage
it's a scarface mob and we're sicker than aids
what i wrote is no joke there's no hope
it's too dope you're gettin' broke by a cutthroat
while bein killed is the price you're billed
there's no time to rhyme and no time to build
steadily the melody plays and steadily bass
is in the place is in your face with grace
sensation and finishin the suckers with my sentencin
you get excited as the rhyme begins you're goin'

smooth with the scarface groove
this the scarface groove
yeah it's the scarface groove y'all

startin to sweat i know it's hard to breathe
rhymes are on time so you better believe
the style sick of the style cause the style is wild
i couldn't never be mild and now i'll begin
to advance in a b-boy stance
the underground sound makes you clap your hands
it's the b-a-y do or die
born to freestyle born to rise
and now i'll keep on rockin' the beat on
no one comin' up short capiche on the mic
you're scared runnin' from the man you fear
p-dog is sick boy you better beware
the man x-rated rated x the man
is comin' through with the jams that keep you clappin your hands
while i'm movin nonstop and the party is smooth
one hundred below ice cold it's a scarface groove

yeah it's a scarface groove

debutin i'll do it for sure by comin' through

makin' sense so intense is the record you bought
i'm stronger strokin 'em longer
stickin them dope mc's go under

swimmin 9 millimeter laps mc'sll drown

2,"this is a test

verse one

too many sounds irritate my earholes
like planet rock beats from la hoes
the same old thing same ol shit i'm tired
was once on the payroll about to be fired
black radio shame pop rap's to blame
program your playlist to sound the same
with a disco tempo cliche intro
wack rap tracks for commercial shows
mindless music for the masses has to take
time away from the real rap master
so i stay cool for community airplay
while ratings slip for the shit that you play
this is a test a lesson to be observed
no wack rhymes are heard i keep on raising the curve
back and forth i never stick 'em soft i just run it
punks'll shun it gangs keep their girlies on it
paris is the dog much doper than morphine
sick with the style so you can say you've seen
the radical magical man master of master plan
so smooth from beginning to end
this is a test back it up when i'm in the place
and all hail to the dog with the righteous bass
the boss i come across rough on your radiowave
terror on two track whenever i'm played
punks keep steppin that's the reason why i
come through sicker than a la driveby
by droppin' bombs in songs y'all keep singin' along
so smooth it couldn't never go wrong
this is a test

verse two

yo dig
when you buy a rap record do you buy it for dance moves
or do you buy rap cause the lyrics are smooth
'cause if you wanna dance you should stick with the other one
and leave the dog alone till the dancin is done
but then when you're ready for the brother who leads
and feeds all rap lovers with rhymes like these
i dish a little taste of the bass of scarface
and paste a rhyme space to chase the weak-kneed
'cause i don't play - well my name ain't cool j backwards
i ain't tc or n-w-a
i'm paris the asiatic lord of light
with the power to fight and write rhymes to stay
'cause i'm hotter than lava when i be up on a microphone
by now you should know it the poet doper than most
by dispensing of ignorance how i'm keeping the wack down
you enter to the realm of the scarface sound
this is a test",2
3,"so the concept is this basically
the whole black nation has to be put together as a black army
and we gon' walk on this nation we gon' walk on this racist
power structure and we gon' say to the whole damn government -
stick 'em up motherfucker this is a hold up
we come for what's ours

now hear the growl i'm proud to be black
built to step up and not to step back
too full grown to allow a gay move
step to the dog and i show and prove
ten point program jams that flow and
pigs end belly up stopped in motion
who's more brutal than a panther unleashed?
paris made to keep the peace
some duck style when i come inside
bougies'll pray i get played and fried

panther power protects the citizen
come on step for the movement

now who that thought they could stop
the crown chief leader of the movement watch
when i say build i mean come correct black
'cause i see straight and i don't play tag
step to this and end up like axl
devils all and p-dog attacks ya
panther power keeps punks from runnin' up
play the front and you might get stomped
witness this the original man
made of earth cream of the motherland
black and strong and not down to half-step
piece is kept police are ripped
p don't plea it's a new direction
strength and unity peace protection

pick the punk and i'll say like wack
stick with the sick style for the serious
hip-hop lovers can't get enough of this
black tracks on wax are so smooth
you can't get help but the thought to move
this is a call and a plea for unity
black is back uplift and be free

i don't burn so don't you dare riff

how ignorant brothers act nowadays

paris is my name i flows with ease
cash checks breaks necks and wrecks mc's

intense is a serious answer
the mic goes into labor you freeze up
enveloped by the style that sounds so rough
rehearsal weak verses potent as cyanide
a million and a half shot keepin' you high
but i don't sell 'cause what you're sellin is never sold
or dealed by the real mack brothers of old
naw i just devise a wise new formula
to keep you in tune without sellin my soul
in 1930 it all began
with a movement comprised of intelligent black men
led by allah in the form of farad
but later by the last true prophet of god
elijah muhammad a dominant black leader
of the lost/found asiatic pack
and later by malcolm whose point was straight
stressing a black nationalistic state
of self-sufficiency on a mission he
stressed thrift and pride and good sense
killed in cold blood but the shit ain't done with
switch to oaktown '66
see huey newton and cleveland seale
sons of malcolm with intent to kill
and end the brutality inflicted on us by cops
best believe i won't stop
teachin science in step with farrakhan
drop a dope bomb word to islam
keeps my brothers up on it 'cause i'm black
and now you know i'm brutal

callin all brothers to order p-dog'll slaughter
stomp rip and choke those who thought a
young black man wasn't capable of the intellect
of gainin respect without sellin so check
i'm paris six feet two deadly as ice
but twice as nice with the power to fight boy
so listen i'm tellin' y'all the warnin the final call
we're headin for armageddeon it's like that
the government's policy see is tactical genocide
how many must die chasin a chemical high?
how much killin' and murderin mayhem more can we stand
before we fold black man so take a stand
listen up drug dealer - whassup with that?
hope i don't bust a cap straight in your motherfuckin ass
for pushin poison to youth i'm through with talkin' i'm steppin up
with gat point blank at your motherfuckin mug
i'm p-r-o b-l-a-c-k

keepin' y'all fresh on the movement tip
with foi at my side we're never slippin or nap
we always come sick-wid-it bustin' serious caps

then give 'em fake gods at odds with allah
love thy enemy and all that hooplah

punks stay put skinheads are flatfoot
keys are played as i stay on route
down the path of the righteous chosen
word is born as the wack stay frozen
locked in time mindset is babylon
p's the martyr while mc's babble on
letter sixteen is me and some see
i freeze and snuff mc's like pipe dreams
makin' a mark with the start of the movement
tracks in fact weak wack can't do this
tooth decay cause the fake been snozin
lead the lost and the cost is you've been
freed from lies by the wise new messenger
p-a-r-i-s is a blessin ya
can't underestimate or recreate
the sounds of scarface let the man break

there is no in-between - you are either free or you're a slave
there's no such thing as second-class citizenship {applause}

the only politics in this country that's relevant to black people
today is the politics of revolution none other {applause}

which brings us to the next move - it's a simple case of
show and tell or rather show and prove
of made up gank moves and foolish fairy tales
said by sissies to snatch the record sales
so when you see me just say i told ya
my rhymes'll hold ya and mold ya to soldiers
and train your brains with the pride and the insight
to do what's right yo black it's yo' life
once upon a time called now we start this
a chosen one came forth from the darkness
to lead the lost for the cost of a beat tape
and make the blind see straight 'fore it's too late
i can't wait time's quickly runnin' out
call to arms revolution's in the house
unforgettable the words of wisdom
brought to life by the ten point system

 one freedom and power to determine our destiny
 two full employment for the black community
 three fight the capitalist with a raised fist
pui black and stack awareness
 four decent housing for the shelter of human beings
 five education and truth for the black youth
 six all black men exempt from military service
hear my words and get nervous
 seven a quick end to police brutality
death of blacks at the hands of the pd
 eight release of all black men who are held in prison
guilty 'fore proven innocent
 nine black juries when our brothers are tried in court
and in addition to all his we want
 ten land bread and housing and education
clothing justice and peace for the black nation",2

again i start this but i'll add a new twist
so the masses can't resist
the message brought by a panther strictly
to relieve the disease of the sickly
so long your mind's been trapped
slave 'cause you're shamed to be black
ignorant of the purpose of the
plan to keep the black man down under
so i'll address y'all this time
make a statement that's on my mind
brothers scared of revolution should be
thinkin' of the way that we could be
miss blue eyes how'd you do that?
tried to put him in but the skin is still black
thinkin' of a way to escape the darkness
see the weave and indeed i start this - off

black is black is black is black - off
black is black is black is black

paris
s-e-d-i-t-i-o-n
in the mood of the move i'm showin
see the way the cliches have been torn
cold spittin' facts to the miracle earth born
so what's your next move black?
go to school or maybe join a frat
still you seem lost the mind is brainwashed
it can't be good cause your mind's the cost
so flip on your young mc
or jazzy jeff or whatever the case be
mindless music for the masses makes ya
think less of the one that hates ya
then trained to respect the game
and you turn your back on a black with the same claim
oh blessed but you guess they mean less
because another brother can't afford to dress
the way you do but who said you're all that?
made a little money now your skin ain't black?
c'mon i don't think your shit don't stink
you can't run from the one whose primal instinct
is to fought the words i taught ya
thought you moved quick but i just caught ya
now you try to say that you don't remember me
i'm p-dog from the bp posse
or a mob that's known as scarface
pro-black and some think pro-hate
but in fact it's a call for unity
heed the plea of weak we're soon to be

move start this
black is black is black is black
enter the darkside
black is black is black is black
dj
yeah funky
dance

paris
now who did you think that you were steppin to
once your job came through
don't get big 'cause i caught your accent
shoulda been real but you wanted mass appeal
next time you might think of this
might remember why i'm above this
but for now my brother i'll say
peace on the positive tip there's a new way",2

wit' a twist of black in the brow twist ya cap and i'm out
sleep wit' the fish-dips for yappin' too loud
what's happenin' now? niggaz is hard as hell but they gargamels
pickin' on the smallest victim gives 'em heart to kill
my squad is real and holds it down the hardest regardless
besides of the largest we polish the floor
with the rawest hardcore artists
flawless victory you niggaz can't do shit to me
physically lyrically hypothetically realistically
i'm the epitome of catchin' wreck catch you when you cash your check
smash you when you pass then jack you for your fuckin' lex
nothin' less than the best if the squad did it
hard-headed niggaz better beware and fear like god said it

ay-yo i warned you now all niggaz could do is mourn you
i'm born to kill and still thrilled i put it on you
there's no regrets remorse only results and loneliness
only the strong survivors strive through life as warriors
all of us die some of us kill even massacred
who wanna try? punisher will if you ask for it
i'm hazardous for your health and hell's your next stop
for real my shit's cocked the world has just stopped
pause

however though i still hold the title
when all my rivals the chance to dance who missed the homicidal
hand on the bible i swear to defend my crown

ay-yo my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact
tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats
half of you lack the magical dap of tragical rap
that tackles you back and shackles and laughs at you
that's the mathematical madness i'm on the savage the strong
the marriage a bond of havoc and song
this massacre's on as if picasso laced you
there's lotsa hateful skeletons locked
in the closet of my castle of grayskull
i'm possum at grade school that's why i have to debate you
my raps are like cables slashin' your face you
that's how a master degrades you
i'm battlin' jesus if he passes through my label
i'm snatchin' his halo
god i pray that you send my father back as an angel
language is fatal and it's hypnotizin'

stressin' to emcees how they don't really want this
electrifying shit his excellency thought spit
these cats they sentimental such with a gentle touch
dancin' double dutch and all sayin' nothin' much
my sound wave liftin' your chin up like uppercuts
new found ways of rippin' shit up i de-ve-lop
your squad chest swell up still you're mini-ay-ture to me

ok nigga lets go",2
6,"ay-yo i shatter dreams like jordan assault and batter your team
your squadron'll be barred from rap like adam and eve from the garden
i'm carvin' my initials on your forehead
so every night before bed you see the bp shine off the board head
reverse that i curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap
'cause he ain't worth jack
hit 'em with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
make his whole body jerk back watch the earth crack
hand him his purse back
i'm the first latin rapper to baffle your skull
master the flow niggaz be swearin' i'm blacker than coal
like nat king i be rapping and tongue's packing
the ones magnums cannons and gatling guns
it's big pun the one and only son of tony montana
you ain't promised manana in the rotten manzana
c'mon-pana we need more rhymers
feel the marijuana snake bite anaconda
i'm in ivana with wine-a try to match my persona
sometimes rhymin' i blow my own mind like nirvana
comma and go the whole nine like madonna
go try to find another rhymer with my kinda gramma

chorus -- when you awaken your manhood'll be taken
fakin' like you satan when i'm the rhymin' abomination 2x

i'm pure adrenaline uncut straight to your gut medicine
raw cure for pain i coat your brain like polyeurathane
simple and plain i'll explain it in layman terms
if you came to learn how to make fire i'm-a make it burn
higher and hotter than lava this scholar
is 'bout just as smart as macgyver
to put honor inside the heart of a lion
revolved in a life of crime crime
fuck it i like the shine shine up in the white and lime lime
comes with the pipe design
plushed out no doubt both pockets about to bust out
if you not in it for the spinach get the fuck out
take a hike we can even battle to make it right
go 'head lace the mic you finished? say good night
head to head in the street i'll leave you dead in your feet
settlin' beef i'll even let you rhyme to the benjamin beat
but it won't matter you dreams still gon' shatter
it's a long ladder to climb and mine is on the stagger
so get outta town 'fore i hit you
with the loudest sound you ever heard
desert bird player you outta bounds

you need the pun to dis you if your whole steez is unofficial
i'll come and get you and let the desert e's tongue kiss you
with one pistol and two clips i'll make your crew do flips
like acrobatics i'm charismatic my gat is magic
it makes rappers disappear whisper in your ear
crystal clear come here let me kiss your tears
everything you fear is here you ain't got to search further
the first murder's the worst now i thirst further for reverse birth
every verse hurts every curse word's already more offending
than eddie murph's worst
i thirst for blood like a vampire any man claimin' his game's tighter
is a god damn liar
i set 'em on fire retire your train of thought
drain a quart of blood out your brain and leave you insane in the dark
the king of new york lays his crown in the boogie down
and sprays the town with a mac hoodied down
i'm no joke yuh i soak your face with a sweeper
dying disgrace i'll face your death through the speaker

i was the luckiest man on earth my wisdom was worth
any purse but had a curse that hurt worse than givin' birth
my first verse explains some of the game she was playin'
i'm blamin myself cause in my wealth was her pain would haven
behavin like a money hungry hooker funny how the money took her
from an average honey to a stunning looker
i look back and reminisce how we used to kiss
and smash hips in the gs i bought her last christ'
she got too big for her britches but the bridge is over
not the one in queens i mean the one she dreamin' wasn't sober
told her how i felt gassed me when she cried for help
supplied the guilt trip and i was whipped without a fuckin' belt
i felt stupid cupid struck me with a poison arrow
shoulda drowned ya when i found ya crushin in my boy's camaro
i didn't bother but you probably find your lover dead
you robbed me of my honor you ain't shit like my mother said

chorus miss jones

come back come back come back come back to meeeee punisher
punish me ahhhhhhhiii've been so bad so bad
won't you come back?

big punisher
nah baby i'm not gon' be able to do it you blew it
threw it all the way cause you was stupid -- girl why'd you do it?
i mighta knew it by the way you gave me your baby
then left a day before i ever saw the son that god made me
it's hard maybe we can make amends be friends
but only hurtin' all of us for certain by forsakin' him
just take it in don't even say a word observe
the way you were preserved these words so you won't play the herb
ever again never pretend that he doesn't have a father
i'm always there and you don't wanna bother
i honor my word on my father's grave guide him through his hardest age
so he can thrive and survive in these modern days
i wanna raise my little man but you keep resistin
i'm insistin you chill for real before you come up missin'
listen i don't wanna fight i'd rather do what's right
a boy needs a father that's the most important part of his life

big punisher
i gave you everything love letters and sweaters with leather seams
feathered wings and rings with emeralds right out of geraldine's
simple dreams a dream fulfilled the green deville cadillac
to mack not a fact redeemed the bill
i mean for real i can play it mami how you wanna stay
armani fresh givin' the next nigga my punani
you want me back 'cause he hit it wrong now you wanna get it on
with the long don word bond my shit is strong come back
girl don't even start again i beg your pardon
and get your hands off my six button cardigan
'cause ain't no love lost between us far as i'm concerned
please leave cut that busted weave i've been dyin' to burn
go buy a perm try and earn some respect
it's better to have loved and lost than live with regret

miss jones
come back to me
i want you to

9,"[verse 1]
the harsh realities of life are takin' toll
even jesus christ forsake my soul
please tell me what price to pay to make it home
take control — i'm makin' dough but not enough to blow
jo's they lust my flows but 'ey yo i don't trust a soul
that's all i know or need to these evil streets'll meet you
halfway and eat you alive tryin' to survive illegal
i'll leave you lost mount you on a cross whip you like a horse
sacrifice your life to a higher force then i'll stomp your corpse
it's the bronx of course recognize the accent?
one of the last livin' still in action general assassins
catchin' any wreck blastin' any tech smashin' any chest
passin' any test — charles manson in the flesh
any last requests before you meet your maker?
sow what you reap or wake up shakin' up a storm like anita baker
i'll take you straight to hell and fill your heart with hate
incarcerate your fate in satan's fiery lake then i lock the gate
make no mistake this shit as real as job we follow the killer's code
when we come for you tell me where will you go?
nowhere to run hide i'll find you and and silence your screams
and even if you kill me i'll still be in your fuckin' dreams

you ain't a killer you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat

[verse 2]
you've made a grave mistake
shouldn't of come here you changed your fate
your brains'll make the debut on the table when i raise the stakes
the pain is great but only for a second it starts strong then lessens
just when you restin' the armaggedon sets in
left him with [?] stress ts blessed him with no regrets yes
welcome to hell son — the threshold of death
face the serpent i blaze your person you get laced for certain
leavin' jakes no trace to work from — close the case like curtains
i'm hurtin' head severely really tryin' to bring the pain
there's nothin' more satisfyin' than when you cryin' screamin' my name
it's not a game it's purple rain floods and bloodstains
big pun's my thug's name bustin' my guns that's my love thang
i'll slit your jug' vein and snatch your adam's apple
john madden-tackle your corpse to hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle
that'll have to hurt i'll work your body 'til it burst
then curse tu vida like a brujeria verse
i'm worse than anything you ever been through sick in the head and mental
essentially meant to be the sole threat against you
when you awaken your manhood'll be taken
fakin' like you satan when i'm the rhymin' abomination

it's hard to analyze which guys are spies— be advised people
we recognize who lies— it's all in the eyes chico
we read 'em and see 'em for what they are
d's in undercover cars takin' my picture like i'm a fuckin' star
i'm up to par my game is in a smash
with half a million in the stash
passport with the gats first name and last
ask anybody if my men are rowdy
give me the mini-shottie i body a nigga for a penny probably
i'm obligated to anything if it's crime related
if it shine i'll take it still in my prime and i finally made it
i hate the fact that i'm the last edition properly a stash magician
could've went to college and been a mathematician
bad decisions kept me out the game now i'm strictly out for cream
doin' things to fiends i doubt you'll ever dream
my team's the meanest thing you ever seen
measured by the heaven's kings down to the devil's mezzanine
i've never screamed so loud— i'm proud to be alive
most heads die by 25 or catch a quick 3 to 5
so be advised the street's full of surprises
it's not what crew's the livest
one that survive it's who's the wisest

just the memory a casualty as i casually make moves on my rivalries
all eyes i be on the quest for loot
pushing a lexus coupe to pursuit them troops against the big-joker
sipping alimoca playing poker with some chocha
heard an approacher must be fam but damn i had to smoke pun
big punisher get the motherfucking gun
since then i've become the one wanted for a lump sum of g's
dirty rats pack gats for cheese
bullets of breeze at light speed
taking your pretty wife life and sacrificing your seeds
indeed we let him bleed for 50 g's
ship his body to the states filled with 50 keys
please no remorse for your two face
inside a symbol my rifle out the motherfucking suitcase
you about to take who's place? not seis
your body'll be laced and left without a trace

big punisher the glamour life the glamour life yo
big punisher chorus

fat joe

the leader terror squad cleaner

street dreamer like nas my entourage is thick
camouflaging this bitch so god forbid you start some shit
my squad's equipped with an arsenal of ammunition
hollow tips an' cop killers with the
accounts in switzerland for rainy days
nigga i'm staying paid you's a joke
always broke with your lazy ways
anyway back to the subject in the bub-lex
in the back seat having rough sex
i love this glamorous life i live having the ice and shit
think twice i give christ your kids
i live life for gifts keep the fire burning while the tires turning
i blaze an l and seek a higher learning
kaiser's learnin' everything illegally
we could de friend for years cross me once that's thievery

big punisher chorus

armaggedon
yo the dough the rap the audience party heavy till the 40's in
ill like the yakuza run the orient
take all the rent and no man wept the path his daughter went
dicks with the fallopian wide as auditoriums
she fuck for dough for opium prostitute emporium
500 benz 500 friends sell cambodian
8's cup of vodka 4 cups of juice for sodium
money money sweet as the smell of magnolia
it's get you down but you spitting image of appalonia
now how can i go broke pumping twenties of coke
plus songs i wrote milkin' dumb honeys i poke
the young blood sat on the bench in vant courtland slingin'
singing how he trying to get cash for jordans
another cat toss his beamer to get the insurance
currency's gonna murder me it's never enough
breakin' my ass gettin' it just as fast as i spend the stuff
calling uncle sam's bluff dun taxes don't bite us bite us

13,"big pun
it's mine it's all mine you understand? just me and my peoples can you dig
that? 21st century but i never see it bottom of the corner baby ours
for the taking

verse one big pun

yo i've seen child blastin a man some with them are turning to murderers
let us stray by the liars' death clause fires observing us
watching us close marking our toast ??? is purposely overtaxing the earnings
nervous burning down the churches
they're scared of us rather beware than dare to trust
throw us in jail million dollar bail left there to rust
lets call in order give ourselves a chance to enhance broader
advance where the minorities are the majority voter
holding my own i'm living alone in this cold world
my sister just bought a home without a loan you know girl
she's an exception some people can leap to the impression
see me myself i start flippin and fall victim to deep depression
i'm stressing the issue here so we can cross the fiscal year
tired of getting fired and hired as a pistolier
there's no longevity living off negativity
fuck it i'd rather sell reefer than do pizza delivery
that's how the city be everybody gettin' they hustle on
judge singin' death penalty like it's his favorite fucking song
word is bond taking my life you know they lovin' it
got off the government and its fuckin' capital punishment

chorus prospect

capital punishment given by the government
systems they organized they get to you and who you running with
can't live alone watch for the spots and tapped phones
totin the k yo for life the rifle heir to the throne
we came from kings in queens people with dreams
gods and herbs for what its worth
we gonna fit the earth with infinite worth
first its turning tables open our own labels
they say don't vote the republicans then reverse capital punishment

verse two big pun

i've seen it all up close shit without the movies you'd be buggin
my cousin juju barely a juve' lost it and turned on the oven
he wasn't playin' blew out the flame and started inhalin
baring a secret too deep to keep on the streets for sharin
wearing the virus acquired immune deficiency syndrome
is dickin every thick premiscuous fish in the sea
listen to me shit is rough in the ghetto you bluff blow your head off
fuck a snuff we bust lead off
get off your high horse or die off like an extinction
boricuans are like mohicans the last of the po-ricans
we need some unity for all the deep security
the maturity keeps me six feet above obscurity
the streets are deadly and everybody's a desperado
i guess tomorrow ain't promised unless you amish and death's your motto
like zorro i mark my territory with a symbol
not with a z but a p cause punishment's what i resemble
i lend you this if it expands yours for you and yours
a real man can't fall he stands tall
the man's claws are diggin in my back i'm trying to hit him back
time to counteract where my niggaz at?

verse three prospect

you like that it's pun and prospect
we hold nines own more treasure than goldmines making progress
with don juan's there's rules to be made crews to be sprayed
dues to be paid nothing y'all can do to behave
we laid in the slums made a cake out of crumbs
even though the government trying to take out our sons
rudy giuliani trying to blind me but i see reality
was raised with this street mentality
my strategies wide my battery never die
the ghetto kept me wise so i would never fall to the lies
its no surprise but to or die if you want the glamour
yeah i want the glamour laid up with cheese and trees in atlanta
my cubans smoked out like ronald isley with havanas
the hammer hit 'em in the palm never shaky calm 'halers
this renegade blow through barricades like grenades
i turn the sun to shade then the night back to day
like the twenty-four hour rotation
i know the location its just a little in-fo-mation
here come the squad bringing the terror for the nine-era
and let it rain on your fine leather nigga what?",2

2pac
dangerous and ambitious while schemin on gettin' riches

currency motivated not easily terminated
now that we made it my niggaz can never be faded
this is my prophecy -- i gotta be paid
all you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves
i thought we was cool i was a fool thinkin' you could be true
when i don't fuck with your punk crew
these are the tales for my niggaz doin' time in the cell
i went from hell to livin' well
bustin' at niggaz who said my name in vain
i got no time for them tricks i'm heavy in the game
i wanna be a baller please
but the bitches and the liquor keep on callin me
i'm floatin free on the highway formulatin plans

3,"verse one daz

you find an mc like me who's strong
leavin' motherfucker's aborted with no verbal support
and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though
with a bear and a snake and a panda i'm on those
who can withstand the mo' power i gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
finally realizing who the fuck we are
when i penetrate it's been withstandin faded
would it be the greatest mc of all time
when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack i crush your pride
my intention to ride every time all night
i'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard i'm faced witha mirage
breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
in and out with my pay
i'm soon to count the bodies

verse two tupac

so mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
so you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
we must be based on nothin' better than communication
known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
sorry i left that ass waitin
no more procrastination give up to fate and get that ass shakin
i'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
you swear the bitches planned it
my lyrics motivate the planet
it's similar to rhythm nation
but thugged out forgive me janet
who's in control i'm acvtivatin your soul
you know the way the games gettin' sold
yo two years ago a friend of mine
told me alize and cristal blows your mind
bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme i wrote
takin' off my coat clearing my throat

chorus method man

i got my mind made up come on come on
get in get in too get on it
let it ride get wit it tonight's tha night
i got my mind made up come on
get in get in too
let it ride tonight's tha night

verse three kurupt

well i comes through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
so my fuckin' sac won't collapse
cause nowaday's shit's evading the x-rays
sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
i wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing mc's
shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
electryfing like thunder i'm just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
i'm an mc with lyrics that's tha fuckin' bom-bay
ya got dissed that's before it's ingest like balmay
my rhymes i leave a mark on ya mind
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sam time
there's no escape nah i ain't blastin
i use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
opposed to laughin' raw maniacal villain
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin'
why is that? 'cause smilin' faces deceive
you best believe to mc's i'm the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camp's under siege and i'm jason vorhees
in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mikes
my verbal snipe your vocab on site
i'm out tha cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat

verse four method man

fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler stickin up jews wit german lugers
the mr meth-tical from staten isle
will be back after this mess-age don't touch tha dial
rarely do you see an mc out for justice
got my gun powder and my musket -- blaooow
melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clan's three deep felons
niggaz best protect they joints for nine-nickel
man i stay on point like icicles
now who wanna test tical then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin mouth
head banger boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight you can pull me
better take one and pass or that's that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast

verse five redman

aiyyo lyrical gas spittin' tha criminal tactics
non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
let's face it there's no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit i'm laced with
avalanche on ya whole camp when i'm splifted
funk doctor who? spock bitch don't get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless tha dogs can't fetch
got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust till every nigga here drop men i fear not
hold ya nose and blow out till ya ears pop
since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
with this underground cannabis
i'm dangerous like john the bomb analyst
then proceeds like keys
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lp's
lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
i'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
confidence for you shaky ass folks
pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke off this anecdote got you ope
get roast by my lyrics billy dee 45 coly
and i'm out for nine nickel ins tha rebel

verse one 2pac

perhaps i was blind to the facts stabbed in the back
i couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
will i succeed paranoid from the weed
and hocus pocus try to focus but i can't see
and in my mind i'm a blind man doin' time
look to my future cause my past is all behind me
is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
everybody's dyin' tell me what's the use of tryin'
i've been trapped since birth cautious 'cause i'm cursed
and fantasies of my family in a hearse
and they say it's the white man i should fear
but it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
i can't lie ain't no love for the other side
jealousy inside make 'em wish i died
oh my lord tell me what i'm livin' for
everybody's droppin' got me knockin' on heaven's door
and all my memories of seein brothers bleed
and everybody grieves but still nobody sees

cause every time i breathe i think they killin' me beeping sound stops
i'm having nightmares homicidal fantansies

i call the nurse cause it hurts to reminisce
how did it come to this? i wish they didn't miss
somebody help me tell me where to go from here
cause even thugs cry but do the lord care?
try to remember but it hurts
i'm walkin' through the cemetery talkin' to the dirt
i'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
there's a ghetto up in heaven and it's ours black power
is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
and our fate is a lifetime of hate
dear mama can you save me? and fuck peace
cause the streets got our babies we gotta eat

i caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow
and even though we separated you said that you'd wait
don't give nobody no coochie while i be locked up state
i kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
said i'll return but i gotta fight the fate's arrived
don't shed a tear cause mama i ain't happy here
i'm through trial no more smiles for a couple years
they got me goin' mad i'm knockin' busters on they backs

so full of pain while the weapons blaze
gettin' so high off that bomb hopin we make it to the better days
cause crime pays and in time you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
you'll feel the fire from the niggaz in my younger days
so many changed on me so many tried to plot
that i keep a glock beside my head when will it stop?
till god return me to my essence
cause even as a adolescents i refuse to be a convalescent
so many questions and they ask me if i'm still down

new york new york is where we live and we're thorough
never taking shorts 'cause brooklyn's the borough
peace to uptown to queens and the bronx
long island and jersey get as fly as they want
where we rest is no joke
so let me break it down to sections for you slowpokes
fort green bedstuy flatbush brownsville
crown heights and east new york will be down till
medina takes respect for the style's we bring
'cause in brooklyn we be into our own thing
alantic terminals redhook bushwick
come to brooklyn frontin and you'll get mushed quick
we ain't just know for flipping and turning out parties
but also for the take no bullshit hotties
on the subject of blackness well let me share this
brooklyn is the home for cultural awareness
so in all fairness you can never compare this
some good some bad little hope for the weak
dangerous streets and coney island beach
all this included when you go for a tour
some can get scandolous and outright raw
when you step step correct and watch where you move
we pay dues so we ain't trying to lose
here in brooklyn
the home of the black and the beautiful
for a ruffrap sound ain't a place more suitable
other cities claim this and others claim that
but let me give some props to the place where we be at
b-r-double o- k-l-y-n
i came in for a visit and ever since then
i've been incorporated with select personel
right here in brooklyn the place where we dwell

way down in brooklyn 3x

verse two

peace to boston philly connecticut dc
all the east coast cities are fly to me
peace to everybody down south and out west
but for me brooklyn new york is the best
don't be afraid to venture over the bridge
although you may run in to some wild ass kids
take the j train the d or the a if you dare
and the 2345 also comes here
there's so much to see 'cause brooklyn's historic
fools act jealous but you have to ignore it
so i just lounge wit the fat clientel
out here in brooklyn the place where we dwell

way down in brooklyn

2,"brave is the knave who steps up to be slayed
by the one who forgave him for his first mistakes
he'd best behave or i'ma send him a wave
of some shocking volts he doesn't know what he's talkin' about
he's kickin a bunch of crap so i'll be the judge of that
the boy lacks artistry but still he tries hard to be
an entertainer but instead he's a waste of
my time and your time so i'll kick the pure rhymes
whenever you're looking for rap that's exceptional
and credible straight to the g's you better go
cause gangstarr's known to be prone to be
masters of streetwise poetry and turntable wizardry
but still be a cold day in hell when you hear that
guru or premier ever tell suckers get sales
but they fail in the long run that kid who went gold yo
that was the wrong one but tonight the spotlight is all on me
i'm the guru of the g-a-n-g
taking out scrubs 'cause they rub me the wrong way
and i'll say that they've still got a long way to go
to show they can flow like a real pro
so gimme that loot catch the boot from my steel toe
i'm changing the scenery as i make 'em uncomfortable
cause most mc's ain't really got no pull
watch me stifle 'em quick with the gift and the wit
make 'em quit all that riff as i flip the script

fool listen i know that you've been missing
all this and so my rhymes are gonna gleem and glisten
like a gem and if you are the fake mc type
i'll shine so bright i'll be blinding your eyesight
your capabilities fall short so i'ma treat you like a dwarf
on a basketball court still you try to rap
and even claim you got new styles but
rolling your tongue's been playe dout for a while
and you don't sound fly so why are you doing that?
you had a dope track but you're wack so you ruined that
i couldn't make out what you were saying your diction
is jumbled where as me i'm conveying clear thoughts
to a crowd that's most critical
booty duck rappers like you are just pitiful
i bet you couldn't name more than one pioneer
cause you didn't pay dues and you got on on outta nowhere
but that's ok 'cause i'm peeping your card
if rap was my house you'd be sweeping the yard
as i recline i'll find more chores to give ya
like moppin the floors or maybe fetchin my slippers
so don't even trip or run off with the lip
cause as soon as you slip you know i'll flip the script

so as i kick a bit flip with script without a skip
butter roll mc's get dissed like this
you'll never got none son because i'll become troublesome
you rap like a simpleton
and i hate scum yo i can easily deflect your threats
'cause they're idle my recital will break you down
just a fight till the end 'cause i can take ten at a time
give 'em all a fair shot to see if any can rhyme
and even if one is decent i'll still get props
i'll kick the slick lines till the last one drops
as my powerful skills are unveiled i'm tippin the scales
and weighing much more than your tall tales
stop the exaggeration perpetration observe
and make simple notation
nobody no where no way no how
is taking me out 'cause i can throw so you know now
can you feel it i bust raps so lay off
before i steal that so called title that you gave yourself
but you really ain't jack so yo you played yourself
and now you look from a distance as you sweat my tip
you know i'll whip you swift when i flip the script",2
3,"verse one

you know i used to be a player fly girl layer and a heartbreaker
lovemaker backbreaker but then i made a
mistake yes i fell in love with this ill chick
sweatin' me for money my name and the dilsnick
my homeboys told me to drop her for it would be to my benefit
she used to say i'd better quit hanging with those derelects
romancing is my thing but i can't swing with no scheming hoes
wherever my beema goes you know that i'm driving
surviving in the 90's is a must so i trust
that everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
i bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
now back to the ex-girls ex-lovers ex-friends
it made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
she phones me and goes on about her new life now
i wish she knew right now
i think she's busted let's discuss it
when i was with her no trust just fights
just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
bow i got my new girl or as i say my baby doll
but i'm still gettin' crazy calls my ex-girl's got balls
don't wanna play the field 'cause i get lovin' at home base
don't gimme no long face just exit with a grace
you and i are the past c'est la vie much respect girl
but now you're my ex-girl 'cause i'm on with the next girl

next
&lt'cause girls look so good&gt

verse two

she had much loot liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
liked to have me near 'cause of my svoir faire
the time we shared was brief 'cause i needed relief
from her high-classed antics and all her conceit
now she's crying wolf and i like don't wanna hear that
i told her the bear facts when things started out
she wines and she pouts about how i did her bad
yo but she'd tried to buy me
even tempt me with the hiney
i fell for a sec 'cause the clothes were real fly
i could almost feel i
would give into her whims
her thoughts were erratic sporadic crazy in nature
i told her hey look i can no longer date ya
tried to pimp with bank and fell short your ship sank
many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
you and i are the past c'est la vie nuff respect girl
but now you're my ex-girl 'cause i'm straight with the next girl

verse three

you saw my mom in the supermarket and gave her your number
you asked how's my sister then asked how's my brother
didn't ask about my father 'cause you know he ain't like ya
every time i left for your crib yo he'd really get hyper
the advice he used to give me makes much sense now
i can't believe i used to let you break my confidence down
you used to ask me why the hell did i wanna live in brooklyn?
you messed up my flow although you were good-lookin'
yes darlin' was fly and this was the problem
'cause back in the day she had me scheming and robbin'
to get her things to wear so when she went to the club
all eyes were on her and me i just bugged
caught in between felling proud and feeling more like a sucker
had to go undercover get away find another
been in brooklyn 9 years and been around the world too
i've seen so many fly girls and i knew just what to do
i went from ex-girl to next took my time with each one
and you know they still love me so stop jellin' me hon
went home to see mom and i saw you at the bus stop
must i stop? nah i think not
you and i are the past c'est la vie much respect girl
but now you're my ex-girl &amp i'm out with the next girl

4,"five carloads deep time to go do a show
got a massive crew and we're ready to roll so
i grab my gear hop in the whip and ride
premier he's got the fly dope system inside
but my shit cranks too and we've got mad tapes
of all the underground groups with the lyrics and bass
off into the new york night we go
dre large got the camera biggest gord's got three rolls of film
so we can take the macked out photos
tommy hill the damaja and my man gusmo
corey and smurf and lil dap's got a forty

mo jt mega and can't forget black
big rob and sincere yes the posse's fat
outloud pulls up plus there's sid and oc
big mel from strong island hl the one and only
o'delicious eli 'bazz and eon
and the aroma of the blunts has me thinking beyond
and to the rest of the crew you know the bond is strong
and you know who's who so let me not prolong
for this was a night to remember
i had on the beige tims with the two-tone leather
so we get to the jam the gig the venue
then we circled around and then drove in through
the front - the place was packed the line was long
i was bobbing my head 'cause the music was on
i turned it down then i peeped to my right
i saw this kid and his girl having a fight
another kid walked up and mushed the kid in his face
and then the kid pulled out and bust him and laid him to waste
a riot broke out girls screaming and scheming crews
started buck wiling tryna' snatch kids' jewels
after that 5-0 came and turned the party out
and then the ambulance came to take the body out
and we didn't even get all the equipment out
and we didn't even get to turn the place out
this can happen often and it's really fucked up
so i'll ask you to your face homeboy what's up?
did you come to see my show or to the stupid nigga playoffs?
killing you and killing me it's the soliloquy of chaos

and if you live in cities where the streets reek warfare
people getting nowhere but you go for yours there
you'll find it doesn't pay to front or play the role
you could get stole or maybe beat with a pole
then you'll wanna retaliate regroup and come back
so you set the brothers up for a sneak attack
whether you die or kill them it's another brother dead
but i know you'll never get that through your head
'cause we're mislead and misfed facts we're way off
killing you and killing me it's the soliloquy of chaos",2

i say people people come on and check it out now
you see the mic in my hand now watch me wreck it now
what is a party if the crew ain't there?
what's your name? call me guru that's my man premier
now many attempts have been made to hold us back?
slander the name and with-hold facts
but i'm the type of brother with much more game
i got a sure aim and if i find you're to blame
you can bet you'll be exterminated taken out done
it doesn't matter how many they'll go as easy as just one
bust one round in the air for this here
'cause this year suckers are going no where
'cause my strret style and intelligence level
makes me much more than just an angry rebel
i'm gifted unlimited rhymes universal
mc's that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle
i'm aiming on raining on the bitch ass chumps
'cause their rhymes don't flow and their beats don't pump
and niggaz better know i paid my dues and shit
i'm bout to blow the fuck up because i refuse to quit
i'm out to get the props that are rightfullly mine
yeah me and the crew think its about that time
but on the dl you know that gangstarr will conquer
that's why you stare and point and others cling on to
my nautica asking for a hookup
well sorry but my schedule is all booked up
nobody put me on i made it up the hard way
look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
'cause it's business kid this ain't no free for all
you have to wait your turn you must await your call
so now now it is my duty to
eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews

yo right now i got my man lil' dap from the group home
yo step up to the mic and tell them why you're the man

verse two lil' dap

so much anger built inside
so don't stop to say hi muthafucka just die
my shit holds a mouthful so i guess you know what's up
why punks get killed at the end of the month
styles and styles i flip
lil' dap remains sick
yes the group home is thick
so all you punks hear this
everytime you riff
the more fame that we get
muthafuckas act hard
thinking that they are god
niggaz just don't understand
let me be my own man
did everything on my own
and everyplace wasn't home
everywhere that i'd rest
i had to dress with a vest
i guess you get the routine but with a lot of stress
frustration on my mind
brothers doin' mad time
rhymes are organized like crime
as we're rippin' the lines
brothers just don't know
how shit got to go
'cause i was told
to never give my back to the street
as i walk through the ghetto
dead souls i greet
see my man give him pound
then i walk with a frown
another minute
another brother's gunned down
shit is getting too close that's why the group home is thick
so every time you riff the more fame that we get
my father always said don't watch the one across the street
watch the one right next
b'cause he's easy to flex
took heed to what he said
yeah that deep ass nigga
while brothers hang around
tryin' to get down
niggaz just don't understand

house the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
dirty rotten scoundrel and my name is jeru
utilizing my tools in '92
mc's step up in mobs to defeat us
when we rock knots and got props like norm peterson
lot's of friends lot's of fun lots of beers
got the skills kreeno so i always get cheers
troop on like a trooper no tears for fears
i'm a get mines 'cause the crew'll get theirs
cut you up like edward scissorhands
you know the program i'm the mutha fuckin' man",2
8,"verse one

i'm 2 deep and yes much too complicated
my lines when stated are quite often underrated
so consider it a privilege to hear this
those weak-minded opinions could never come near this
for my outlook on life is a profound view
whil the suckers act down thinking that they sound new
only a few sound true
me and the crew know who
'cause you see me and the fellas have been waiting for a while now
giving you the time to get your wack-ass style down
you punks pop junk as if life is a fantasy
knowing that hard is something you can't be
so you front but you could never call my bluff
'cause you'll catch hell you'll get dealt with

i never sleep
i always peep
rhymes creep
i'm 2 deep
i'm 2 deep

verse two

i forgive you sike i'm takin' your life
'cause you continue to disrespect so i'ma get trife
but then again i think i'll spare ya
'cause i know tht all it takes one rhyme just to scare ya
see i'm the holder of the key
don't ask me if i'm muslim don't say nothin' to me
i said i was raised like one son i had two cousins
they pushed me to find myself or else they knew i wasn't
gonna make it and then end up a statistic
my life was twisted i almost missed it
the chance yes the chance to make you feel good
i used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good
but now i got k-n-o-w-l-e-d-g-e of self 'cause i'm me
and the nation of islam has my support
'cause they try to reeducate the ones who are lost
and the 5 percent nation takes other steps
to get through to brothers on the corners with the reps
and in the prison they give the brothers new visions
of how we can gain wealth gain self esteem and dream
of a total different scene i dress clean stand lean
say what i mean and i'm out
like a scout on a new route exhibitting clout

verse three

for right now yo my religion is rhyming
perfect timing test the flow and climb in
ansaar sunnite sheite jihad
all must regard the times are hard
unite or perish
is the message i cherish
that goes for my people of all religions
if we're all black why have so many divisions
superficial factors are drawing us apart
don't let it happen
let's put some respect back in
so before i act i think 'cause it's the brink of destruction
word corruption what's up son your gun is just one
and i just might have one
or two or maybe even three or four
and plus an army of 100 or more
but violence is never my first choice
i come in peace to release the effect of my voice",2
10,"as i deliver rhymes with ease and walk around with my head up
i'm dead up serious so don't be getting too curious
motherfuckers always wanna know what makes me tick
i'll pull a phrase out quick 'cause i'm dipped and i'm slick
you thought that i would slip 'cause you seen me drinking forty's
it shocked you then you told your friends you saw me
well say what you want 'cause all of mine is in tact
in fact i'll have you open like a hookers gap
i like to catch a buzz 'cause i get into the beats more
mc's are washed up like dead fish on the seashore
save the talk 'cause you know i walk that walk
hitting city to city but i make my home in new york
i know the time with this rap shit 'cause they got it all backwards
they need to take a hint or catch my microphone imprint
straight to the dome through the skull to the tissue
call me guru i'll diss you if you're pressing the issue
not my style to be sweatin' all the stupid ass rumors
i take it as a compliment and fuck you too
if you're scheming on the chance to put a stain on my name
don't even think about it 'cause ain't no shame in my game

no shame in my game

stick to the subject i ain't afraid to be real
a lot of mc's fake hard just to gain appeal
i like some gangster rap don't like the prankster crap
so i get passed all that by kicking straight up facts
there ain't no reason to shoot unless you got beef
if you pull out and you don't use it than you may catch grief
toolies and techs ain't toys but kids got 'em today
and if they're ready to spray best get the fuck out the way
i try keeping my sanity by thinking of better times
if i write clever rhymes then maybe i'll climb
but what the hell's success if the mess ain't changing
50's still corrupt stupid gangs still bangin'
stick up kids still stickin' nasty hookers still trickin'
all the pimps still pimpin' and all the crackheads trippin'
while the dealers still sellin' so i'll refrain from the yellin'
and the preachin' 'cause who the fuck would i reach man
niggaz don't wanna stop that they wanna live fat
who'd wanna clean up their act when the papes come in stacks
they live for the minute and they're all wrapped up in it
it's an unfortunate state for many it's too late
now death stalks the streets and it's right at your gate
so bug lose your mind but i ain't goin' insane
i'll kick the fly lyrics 'cause ain't no shame in my game

no shame in my game

life's a bitch so who are we to judge each other
i know i got faults i ain't the only motherfucker
stuff i heard about you wasn't too cool you know
like how you smoke wools and that your girl's a ho
but i don't listen to shit unless the story's legit
knuckleheads need to quit 'cause they be riding the dilsnick
but i'll be taking care of business regardless
and when it comes to rhyming you know i'm hitting hardest
so you can kick dirt but in the end you'll feel pain
you little sucker there ain't no shame in my game",2
11,"you can't tell me life was meant to be like this
a black man in a world dominated by whiteness
ever since the declaration of independence
we've been easily brainwashed by just one sentence
it goes all men are created equal
that's why corrupt governments kill innocent people
with chemical warfare they created crack and aids
got the public thinking these were things that black folks made
and every time there's violence shown in the media
usually it's a black thing so where are they leading ya
to a world full of ignorance hatred and prejudice
tv and the news for years they have fed you this
foolish notion that blacks are all criminals
violent low lifes and then even animals
i'm telling the truth so some suckers are fearing me
but i must do my part to combat the conspiracy

the sat is not geared for the lower class
so why waste time even trying to pass
the educational system presumes you to fail
the next place is the corner then after that jail
you've got to understand that this has all been conspired
to put a strain on our brains so that the strong grow tired
it even exists when you go to your church
'cause up on the wall a white jesus lurks
they use your subconscious to control your will
they've done it for a while and developed the skill
to make you want to kill your own brother man
black against black you see it's part of their plan
they want to send us to war and they want to ban rap
what they really want to do is get rid of us blacks
genocide is for real and i hope that you're hearing me
you must be aware to combat the conspiracy

even in this rap game all that glitters ain't gold
now that rap is big business the snakes got bold
they give you wack contracts and try to make you go pop
'cause they have no regard for real hip-hop
they'll compare you to others and say but yo he sells
and you know in your heart that he's weak as hell
so you say i ain't doing that corny stuff
but they tell ya that your chart positions will go up
sometimes they front big time and make you many promises
and when they break 'em then your mama says
son you're making records but that guy seems shady
it could be too late and your career could be played gee
i hope you listen to the things that i'm sharing see
we all have a job to combat the conspiracy",2
12,"gotta be the illest brother to claim respect
it takes the illest brother just to get respect
got to be the illest brother when it's time to get wreck
got to be the illest brother when i get my mic check

i'm one of the illest brothers known to man
but if you don't understand see i'm a grown man
and i stand 5'8 and 3 quarters
giving orders to my sqaudron 'cause i'm like the sergeant
or general but let me keep this minimal
i used to hang with kids who like to live trife with a knife
cutting kids for fun and pulling out much guns
and like riflery champs fellas start to get real amped
dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement so i gave it some thought
remembering the brothers who are gone now
i will make a strong vow to make things right
ignite the mic get hype and all that
suckers try to menace but they always fall
flat to the ground as i astound come around
i'll put you down about the brothers who think they're the boss
think they're getting large but in the end they pay the cost
of their lives and that ain't the way to go out
even take their boys with 'em 'cause they know their boys will go out
but when it comes to facing some time
they're like crying like weeping wanna call mom dukes
but mom dukes is fed fed up with the shit you did
she knows that you shot and she knows that you cripples kids
but who's to judge when you're trying to survive
the one who moves first might be the one to stay alive
so when you think you're hard and dominating the set
just remember the illest brother claims respect

like i said i'm an ill kid so never dare test me
they wanna arrest me 'cause i'm causing a frenzy
fake gangsters come and fake gangsters go
real gangsters chill 'cause real gangsters know
that quietly you stalk your prey on the down low
'cause too much talk will get you beef on the street
and brothers in the city have to live this way
it may cause dismay but imma' tell it anyway
yo guns are easy to get and like a puppet
some young kid is gonna be the subject of internal oppression
an example of hard times
'cause to make it out the trap in your mind it's a hard climb
but even if you change and come right and exact
there's another brother scheming so just watch your back
i know a brother who thought he had it all
but little did he know he was bound for a down fall
he'd pick up the heater and go stick somebody
he wouldn't give a damn if he killed somebody
'cause if somebody would get in the way of him getting loot
there'd be no hesitation he'd just shoot
it's like the good the bad and the ugly
except it's reality and you don't see it on tv
brothers keep dying in the streets 'cause the streets are designed
to keep you from having peace of mind
i know an old man he's got a rifle to stifle
any young punk he hides it under his bunk
and i know a kid who's been to jail
and he told me that the system had failed him
so now he's out the joint and he's like flippin' on kids
and the people in his neighborhood are flippin' their wigs
but you gotta check the move 'cause there's a reason
a method to the madness and you know what i'm meaning
'cause rather than being the herb vic or chump
you can be just like my man cold holding the pump
but living like that you take a chance with your life
but some things in life sometimes will make you uptight
i'm like an avalanche of knowledge pounding down all fools
all fakes all snakes
and ones who try to break the rules and regulations
stipulations made by the gangstarr
you try to flex muscle but you know you can't hang ha
you're making me vexed but yeah you can go next
just remember the illest brother claims respect

chorus repeat

yo money don't front you know you blew your chance
and now it's my turn so imma' take command
'cause i'm like the one who's got all the juice
i always get loose i got the balls to reduce your crew
very easily i got more ammo
i'm like the ill kid the psycho man yo
'cause now i'm past the point and i ain't gonna return
and when it comes to your destruction i ain't really concerned
about the consequences 'cause i'm living day to day
so who are you to comment about me and my ways
i get my attitude from living and i never forget
you got to be the illest brother just to claim respect",2
13,"now i got you looking stiff you numbskull you're at a stand still
still faking that you're hard with your rhymes and got no hand skills
so i'll easily drop you and stop you from rhyming
send you home to moms all bruised up and crying
then if you want you can go call your people
you're gonna need a mob against me 'cause i'm lethal
not that i'm a violent brother to the contrary
my vocals carry and then i bury
mc's in holes that they dug for themselves
couldn't be themselves so they sold themselves
to a company exec who doesn't have respect
for real rap music so he wants to get an mc
that starts out street to crossover
but not me 'cause i'm the hardcore composer

you ain't a writer nor a fighter you're just a biter
i think you need to save all that because in spite
of the reputation that you think you have
the crew already knows that you're really a crab
so i'll grab the mic with haste and send you out of this place
and back to trace my flow but don't waste your time bro
it only takes a minute a second for me to switch
and rearrange real quick 'cause i can kick plenty styles
rhymes stretch many miles
i'm the authentic yes the lyric unloader
the truth exposer the hardcore composer

all you delirious curious suckers
you better act like you've been known i mack
and hold my own with a mike just to stagger
a bragger retire a lair and very easily
i'm pass by ya cause you didn't want to give the credit
where it was due yeah it was you uh huh it was you
and your crummy corny ass crew
so we shall enforce that you lost and plus you oughta
find another type of life and yes another source of income
and here's some advice you can't rap this nice
i broke ya over and over i told ya
i would mold ya why? because i'm bound
to give original sound and as your ears pound
bringing pleasure and pain
as brains start to gain from musical measures
forming mystical questions never typical inventions
developed by my gifted unlimited mind
suckers wanna rhyme 'cause they're eager to find
the secret behind the way that i stomp all comp
just like a timberland it's the guru and premier
it's them again droppin' the fly tracks
and taking things over and never selling out
'cause i'm the hardcore composer",2
14,"i'm like a sniper rhymes'll strike ya when i'm rockin'
mad chicks be jockin' when the g starr's talking
and that's because my word is bond
i get much fan mail and i always respond
so tell your hon to write me too
make sure she puts attention mr guru
brothers know the flow is unique
i got 100 wild styles in my black valise
mc's wanna be me so they keep askin
for me to teach 'em methods both slow and fast
and others wanna act as if they're better
but they only got one style which ain't all that clever
i'm cooler than wind harder than cold steel
i get the ladies with more than just sex appeal
a mystic psychic scanning all your thoughts
i'll touch your soul and make your brain feel caught
when my rapture traps ya and makes you mine
you'll submit to the gift and to the lyrical lines
so suckers realize that the size is too large
when i come through i'm pullin' whole crews cards
i be wreckin' correct and on the gang starr tip
mc's who front imma' gonna bust your shit

i wonder do you love it enough
i'm steppin' rugged and tough never to front or to bluff
i got the fresh cut baldy the brothers call me
guru the man yes with all the
j-a-z-z-y type essence street type lessons manifesting
the one who make the fly ladies feel pleasant
never forgettin' that to myself i'm true
do what you want to but watch yourself though duke
i don't wanna hear all of that loud mouthing
try to pull yours out when nothing comes out
then you'll see why you can't compete with me
the notorious guru of the gang you see
starr stands for power like i said before
i'm like the doctors cure slicker than roger moore
i slide up to a crab mc like this
tap 'em in the head with my mic like this
i'll be revealing that you're weak to the world if you wish
and i insist that if you persist
then you get creamed 'cause imma' get real steamed
so don't you try to flex and try to look all mean
heyo check it that's dead that's it
'cause all you phony ass rappers imma' bust your shit

now when you see me on the set you know i may unleash
a lyric like a mad dog barking through the speaker
step off unless you wanna get torn up
your raps worn out burnt out fucked up
you lucked up or maybe you lucked out
'cause at the battle last time you snuck out
but now i'm rolling over you full blast
i'm here to let you know no longer will the bull last
mc's telling lies and poppin' all those myths
keep on fakin' moves and imma'",2
15,"verse one

other mcs in the place know i'm much too much
and i'll bust 'em all up without even cussing
all wannabe's are never ever gonna be nothin'
gang starr's in the house and we're crushing
so suckers better be up on their p's and q's and
competition come against me and you're losing
i'll use a simple style just to catch you snoozing
wake up wake up kid read the news and
take heed 'cause you need to see how battles are won
when a real man displays how it must be done
and i snuff bum mcs and keep the cashflow comin'
and never had no problems getting women
i'm like a catalyst causin' a chain reaction
dopest vocalist ad now the main attractionn
things turn gold at my slightest touch
that's why the people say that i'm much too much

i'm much too much
i'm much too much
i'm much too much
i'm much too much

verse two

check the g-u-r-u yes the brother who's progressing
if beats are cake i'm frosting if salad i'm dressing
never stressing or guessing or messing around man
just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
blasting out your radio my vocals surrounding
take a trip uptown and come back down and
and kick it with the fellas i call my crew so
i'm gettin' kinda fat like a big huge sumo
i figure that i'm due and it's true 'cause you know
a rapper this nice oughtta clock mad dough
not the stuff from the baker but the loot yo the paper
i set up shop and drop gems and catch 'em later
'cause i'm like keeping it moving improving steadily
pumping kinda loud in your blazer or cherokee
doesn't matter what you drive automatic or clutch
just pop in my tape 'cause i'm much too much

verse three

i walk in the room unload a boom that's like sonic
my slick voice to the beat is symphonic
to a biting mc my lines are toxic and chronic
my mystical style is like harmonic
i've rarely had a difficulty slaying mcs
'cause the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
and i wreck the set with the greatest of ease
and you know i'm swift like the breeze
i'll never understand why a wack rapper tries and
convinces himself that his image is so fly and
that's the type of crap you know i'm not buying
chumps lack the beats and their rhymes don't apply and
that's why i've come into your life today
just to make you sweat in my unique way
i'm controlling all action dissing mc ducks
that's why everybody knows that i'm much too much

16,"intro/chorus

take two and pass 3x
so the blunt will last

take two and pass so we can all get blunted
don't smoke ciggarettes so my growth ain't stunted
we got at least five head so i rolled a white owl
it's the break of dawn and we're awake like night owls
phillies are cool but they burn much quicker
 hey yo come on pass that shit nigga
we lounge to the sounds as we leave from uptown
it's time to go downtown and make some more rounds
this city never sleeps that what sinatra sang
for that fat fat blunt you know i got this thing
so hand it over 'cause i wanna get charred
i'm in love with mary jane she keeps me large
so don't hog it let's get it moving real fast
everybody just chill and take like two pulls and pass

the club is crowded everyone's up in here
heyo premier what's that you got there?
it looks like a nice plump blunt in your hand
i just know you're gonna share it with me 'cause i'm your man
so bust it i got one too and if you spark up yours
i'll light up mine when it's through
oh shit there goes my man the fat mack
we used to get blazed i know he's got a fat sack
let's go upstairs grab a chair and unwind
so the la la can enhance our minds
the system booming let the bass increase
i find me a seat so i can peep the chic
ladies and maybe get my homeboys some ass
all you gotta do is take two pulls and pass

even in the morning like the flavor of juice
a blunt adds spice and a blunt can spruce
up your day but i'm not advertising just telling
of aspect a part of our lives
and around the way there ain't no shame in our game
cause the fame is no thing we get together and hang
and since you know i got dash and class
then i'm after you so take two pulls and pass",2
17,"verse one

get with this get with this
get with this 'cause you got no choice
rappers sometimes you'll find make dough
but yo you know they've got no voice
get him off the podium he ain't no speaker
yes he's just a phony and look at his sneakers
played out of style out of rhymes
he's out his mind
lost his way lost his pay
i'm takin' his props so call the cops
you can call 'em but i know 'em
sweet mcs i think i'll ho 'em
'cause they front so very hard and big or small
i'll break 'em all
ain't gotta say that i'm the best
my skills will show i passed the test
when it comes to beats and rhymes
we come correctly every time
and stay tuned

stay tuned

verse two

with information like the cnn
i can take you there and then
the rest is up to you to choose
the bottom line is win or lose
suckers suckers suckers don't be listening
so i can't be waitin' on 'em
i ain't got no time to play do you?
look at the state of things and tell me true
in the city any city life's a paradox of good and evil
many fall into the vicious cycle
living by the gun or by the rifle
think they got a reason that ain't really sure
the death toll rises more
it's trife the way some live life
i love rap i like the city
but for a fool i have no pity
there'stoo much suffering too much struggle
too much injustice and don't it bug you
enough for you to press on harder
against the odds the wayn our forefathers
made away but foolishly we go astray
think about it and stay tuned

verse three

what you really oughta do is lay back smooth
as my vocals compliment the slow fat groove
just for you to blast around the way
play it nice and loud and hear me say
gang starr is hitting '92 and on
showing how to make a dope rap song
doing this while some disperse
then dissolve like specs of dirt
our music pertains to those who remain
down with the real not wealth or the fame
peace out we'll be back stay tuned

please stay tuned",2

or are you full of sheep
tryin' to pull the wool

second verse

what's goin' on black?
you want a hand to smack
well i can never be all that
so i will give you daps
i do the 'hey yo'
your girl is on the strobe?
oh no that's kind of trip
but gee i gotta go
you see it's not the style of me
so i'm not mending
and i won't pull you leg
nor start pretending
to be a fair weather
with a plea to come

don't say i can't i know that i can
black sheep rule me and my man
or my man and i mista lawnge and dres

as for me to say just how
you didn't know me then
so you could never know me now

third verse

what's goin' on hon?
you say you're out for fun
i got a pocket full of posies
you say i got a fun
then take a step back
away from flipper
i'd rather shoot you with the joint
inside my zipper
but not to be fresh
for then i lose the groove
i'd rather see you smile
and move your booty smooth
then i get to know ya
got things to show ya
is there the chance
of me gettin' over
and over and over and over and over again
now tell me
are you gonna let me in
for it's gettin' hot
what i have have not

i have a mansion and a yacht
a caddy for my daddy
somethin' new for mom too
a coat for mista lawnge
and some hook-ers for the crew
honey don't get mad
you know my love is greater
but i'll dig you later

'i can dig it' x6

to move to the forefront take my rounds

i'm looking for susie or wendy or judy
but look at her repeat 3x who me?

never see us sweat and you'll never see us drool
out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
don't punch girls and we don't punch a clock
gotta go gotta go see you later by the cat

i'm sick and tired of rappers not real
and suckers makin' it with a pop feel
labels signin acts with nuff bills
tax write off cause you have no skills
you go make a demo
get a deal and start to sprout
gold platinum and then start sellin out
you get a benz and trash the nova
double platinum and start crossin over
then you get fall i won't give examples
hint hint they use the same old samples
but not the sheep
for we are sleek and unique
top of the peek and others are weak
follow the words that i speak
the situation is bleak
but this is the fly shit that you seek
when the style is dope

and claim to have brains
take the funky drummer and give him back to james
i'm dope i'm dope
heh i can't cope
keep your cordless cause you bore this
you say you're sure yeah
but i'm the surest
that black sheep are unique
funk clever brothers that will
make the church girl freak
out without a doubt
you have no wins in a '91 bout
so shout pout do what you want
but you're out the picture
and i'ma get you sucka
cause youse a dumb mothafucka
better off as a tractor trail trucker
but movin right along to the woodstock
stop remember when the band was on rock
negro music heh separated
it blew up and became rap
and you hated it
that's of course till you see
a motherfucker that could be in your family
drop lyrics then you hear it
with glee then only thing it tells me
is that you know a good thing
when you see it
you run to get a ten
cause you cannot be it
so off the top off my head
i guess i keep it rollin'
till ah the rap gets stolen
like so many other things called theft

when i first saw ya i thought that i knew ya
now i know i don't just wish that i did
honey made a right stepped off took flight
upstairs up more made a left and hid
looked down at my shoes and the cuff in my slacks
hand inside my pocket came out with somethin' stickin
doublemint goes in my mouth jaws are breakin north and south
look around to see who's lookin' figure that my breath was kickin so
in the bathroom i go and fixing his 'fro
 you guessed it the lawnge one
'what's up black?' goes the hand smack
i get the feeling that it's time for some black sheep fun
the club is on the bourgeois urinal holding a cigar
then you never know probably a phillie
lawnge cracks a smile oh no here it comes then says
yo dres honey made you look silly
step back in the joint and yeah it's kinda funky
my breath no longer kickin so now it has pep
strobelite hoe that i don't know
walks up asks lawnge's sign we quickly do the step

where you at hon? where you at?
where you at hon? where you at?
where you at hon? where you at?

dres
then i change my style
movin through the crowd the smoke has got me chokin
funny that i'm chokin could it be that i am smokin'
pounds are goin' round but this is nothing new
hoping that eloping with a dip is what i'll do
system's kinda boomin like a drive-in called the sonic
find the bar kid my state of mind would like a tonic
there she goes where? take my thoughts out of the dumps
lawnge over there over there look at bumps
from the time that she was born she was raised to be all that
gave her no food what? strictly similak
felt like a punk on dick street a coupon in the ghetto
i said 'hon whacha drinkin'?' she said 'milk and amaretto'
i took a seat beside her i would not be denied
i ordered liit and fill 'er up she's got a rider
she showed her dental work and said i looked familiar
i touched her on the hand i had to feel her

similak child drivin' me wild
simi-limi-lak child - you're definitely winnin'
similak child drivin' me wild
simi-limi-lak child - you're the woman

dres
i said 'hey' she said 'hi'
i said 'us' she said 'try'
'and if you're thinkin' strictly boots then i'll say baby bye bye'
she said 'i know you got at least a dozen that you're seeing
you think you own the world at least new york because you're g'ing
you claim to be the man you want me for a lover
so you can do my girlfriends and my sister and my mother'
i said 'you're very blunt with quickness to the cue
so whassup with your mother does she look as good as you?
i'm playin' but let me not delay in what i'm sayin'
initially attraction found your way before the weigh-in
i'm single so i've got at least a dozen on my door step
doesn't boost my ego it doesn't mean we've slept
i'm in the public eye so i try to be an eyeful
do not own the world but yes i have some pull'
my chorus rose a brow she's curious of me
'please give me more iced tea and her vitamin d'
she said 'me?' yes 'why?' guess
sweetheart you've got ten cushions besides i like your dress
i'm playin' but let me not be weak and let me speak
your mind is brighter than your booty it's the courtin' that i seek

similak child drivin' me wild
simi-limi-lak child - you're definitely winning

simi-limi-lak child - you're the woman",2

van damme
let's see what kind of flavor i want
do i want vanilla?
or do i want a taste of chocolate?
hmmmmm i want something different i want somethin' slammin'
what's the slamminest flavor out this month
let's see
yo black hmmmmm what flavor are you?

first verse

note the way he says listen i wanted to spell it lehsen

listen
for a second i'm wreckin
i got ya double checkin'
then again
when to you knees did you beckon
hold me only if you wanna get naked
play before a crowd only if you wanna wreck it
the name is dres like silk i get slick
drop rhymes like a basehead bic flicks
constantly yes it's me
d-r-e-ssssss
so yes i guess unless confess
you can get down
to serious business with this
i never boned a honey that i didn't like
i never saw a mile that i couldn't hike
i never had a spliff to make me choke
i never had a pocket that was broke
hate no one but love only a few
franklin grant and yeah mom too
i run buckwild for self or with the crew
but then again huh i thought you knew
now i hear the voice
is it what you want?
i hope it is kid
you're the flavor of the month

i heard you got the fever for the flavor x3
somebody said you got it goin' on
i heard you got the fever for the flavor &gtx3
hurry up and get a scoop before it's gone

second verse

so you got the fever for the flavor of the other
chocolate sasspirilla or is it you like another
flavor in my socks
to the curly locks
black sheep rollin' hard
and kncokin peons out the box
never have i ever never
ever felt much better
did the whole nine
on the tenth i was no wetter
ready and i'm eager
eager as a beaver
on the radio and good to go
says your receiver
not to be the baddest
or the oldest nor the wackest
neither am i needest
or the newest or the blackest
just a brown fellow
who's not afraid of jello
to the people of the world
i would like to say g'day
had to wait a while
but the while has been waited
never gave up hope
in myself nor debated
didn't shed a tear when i wasn't picked
'cause i got a cone now want a lick?

third verse

now i catch a number
when before i caught a glare
now i give a pound
when before i got a stare
now i guess i kinda got it goin' on
i get a wake-up call on the lawn
i used to try and push a demo
now i have a coupe
that's a bit more than a little
but then not quite a few
funny how they find you
when they told you get lost
tell me why you're grittin
when you have no dental floss
wasn't my loss
thought you were the boss?
you never knew how much the sherbert cost
forget it i never sweat it
your girl will give me play i'll wet it
it only happens just because you let it
now everybody wants to play my phone
i see 'em with a spoon
i see 'em with a cone
you never knew i knew it
but i knew you would pursue it
hurry up and get a scoop before it's gone",2

lyrics

i been around i been around

although you know in a minute
right now you know not who i be
so i kick it for a second
yes i kick it for a sec
get wreck and double check
got to play with your select
name is dres d-r-e-s
yes i guess that it is
ya gotta bag of buddha well smoke a sess
i'm the type of brother that the girls always select
it's not because they're out to come
it's 'cause they're out to come correct
i talk about a ho because a ho i know
and if you do the honey tea
then i guess too you would talk so
play me not if my phone book is bigger
don't get hot 'cause i clock the fat figure
told ya i'm a singa got my finga on the trigga
cause everybody hates the fly nigga
play me not close if your jean is made of plastic
if your best to play it down
then you should walk faster
don't give me a pound if you bust that in your hand
play me out never 'cause i came to understand
do it to for a minute
i do for me too
push me up and i'll pull myself through
watch my back and i'll watch my front
got what i want c-ya hate to be ya
got a nie got a shot got a catch twenty-two
damned if i don't and i'm damned if i do
fightin over cities how they're fightin on my block
over there is liberation over here is for a rock
no not pop rock no not pop rock
do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
do-do-after shock
some will part fly gear while others are suckin
i game i use to play until i learned to keep steppin
but one thring i learned yo roll and take it
life is what you make it",2

fuck you fuck you fuck you",2
1,"let's begin
asalaam alaikum people of good will
i offer you the greeting of thought manifested skill
to finally reveal the open-end chapter
as real as the flesh that you're embodied in
to the skull cavity your mind is rotting in i'll be riding in
and there might have been a slight rotation warp to curve
the course of course i'm cordial when i'm reportin
i won't distort i don't contort
connect conduct collect console or conceal
in full control of the roll of the wheel
my eyes are my appliance to decipher the science
omitting defiance with the high-tech mic check
the buttons that flashed i pushed for absolute
destruction your structure is lifted from the ground
the foundation mound is broke so you float around
i'm embedded in what is known as beat
let it be shown every enzyme is complete
in time you'll see the pace of the pulse pump
rapidly heart rate happily marched
i happen to be the dark man who holds the charts
i arch my horizontal line to make a rainbow
 but it ain't the same though yo
the tried and true pros are chasing fool's gold
sliding through holes like small rodents
it's obviously evident my embellishment
peaks at two-ninety-two iq
cause big ace is the spinner in the center
inventor and i plan to be a winner meaning
i'll be in inner outer ovaries overload overboard
overseas hearin oversees more than the eye can
i stand limited primitive sentimentalist escapist
the way i shape this landscape automatically makes this vivid
i give it a rivet hold it stand at the pivot
i love it learn to live it then give you my exhibit
not inhibited not even a little bit when i'm inclined
my attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
and you can play the sidelines ride rhymes in your spare time
my attempts to redefine your hip-hop guideline
you can play the sideline ride rhymes in your spare time
'cause i'd rather stimulate your mind than emulate your purpose
and we have only touched on the surface of the serpent
consider me part of the dust in the dusk
i must collect the samples from the rust
penetrate the crust then trust no living
driven by the sonic language passion
your ashes spark the flashes of the neon
from be-yond what kind of planet could i be on?


i don't know but i'ma be on for eons and eons
while many think that they can never play out
get trapped in a timeframe and never find their way out
i stay off the dramatization and i balance
always seeking the challenge to show the world
the incredible talents i cut the corners smooth out the surfaces
worthlessness is just half of the problem
i read the greek kid i did every column
i note the animal kingdom and the phylum
whylum style em until they get to hit the target
i mark it on the bullseye of flies
and the buffalo wing in the sky
my architectnique sparks the dark streets of your resting ground
i suggest that you warn your town
i inhabit the oxygen mark off the memory
you will never forget to remember the lone wolverine
marine biologist machine with the verbal
internal mind fertile foot over hurdle
tight like godel and my word'll be the last
i incubate every other millineuim
i fast and i hibernate to pass any of em
i am potent untraceable
no color no odor no taste no replaceable parts
no heart no head just a carcas
the darkest days come right before the light
i watch my watch and stand right before the mic
by the powers vested in me i digested mc's
food for thought caught on to the end of the rope and swung
then stood stiff as if i was on a cliff
not beneath sticks my feet are made of bricks
when i walk my footprints end in cement
i am not practical nor am i unusual
nor am i oblivious to hideous crimes
every city is captured and trapped in my mind
given the spinal tap as the final rap climbs
my attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
you can play the sidelines ride rhymes in your spare time
my attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
you can play the sidelines ride rhymes in your spare time
'cause i have become the night owl on the prowl
master of the freebin pile style
'cause i'm om-nipotent
i'm some government experiment that is out of control
i'm from some big black hole
i square up select and rec'd every tangle
i flare up and you can try any angle
even bermuda but i bury the barracuda
then i'm octa-gone in the wind with the pollen",2
3,"mr mix mr dj play that beat
won't you play if for me in the mix mister hop
forward hop back hop hop hop

the second somebody dies somebody else is born
people are celebrating while other people mourn
home may be home to you but to me it's foreign
even the matador don't pull the bull by the horns
one man's enemy is another man's friend
one man's poisons is another man's medicine
so let us stand let us sit and let us view
the changing of the guard oh it's so hard to keep it true
it's the balance of the scales it can't be challenged or expelled
soon as somebody lost somebody else prevails
some someone is quiet at the same time someone yells
half full or half empty water in the well
it's the half and half hypothesis the 50/50 theory
eerie as it may seem check your balance beam
it's the half and half hypothesis the 50/50 theory
eerie as it may seem check your balance beam
now check your balance beamer with a feather and a rock
wheath or not you find the answer is really not the plot
see it's like love and hate love and hate
the same emotion different weight
people love to hate so i know you know just how this all relates
it's the posa and the nega tive
mini and mega live
arm a leg a leg an arm headed by a nigga
like big and small
short and tall
night and day and so on
some people are bashfull
some people just love to get their flow on they flow on
so here goes one to grow on
i'm a go on and on and on till the principles are laid out
the scales of justice weighed out
till your memory starts to fade out and your game of life is played out
got to balance out the power don't we?
balance your emotions
push and pull positions like the moon pulls on the ocean
balance on one foot that's equilibrium
opposites attract and retract that's a fact


i'm a libra y'all
180 degrees but not that hot
so whether or not you find the answer is really not the plot really not the
plot
because giving is receiving and and seeing is believing and
and the solar system rotes so harmonious and even
it's perfectly balanced

some people say life is about taking chances choices and decisions
voices and opinions politics and religion
clues the past and cash and keys to the future
it's a possibility and probability on who's gonna execute yo ass
some slow and analytical
some quick fast on the dash
like heads or tails but the head usually leads the tail
so i tell my tales from the head
'cause they're embedded inside my cells
real quick let me tell you about a fact i know things will even out
you can disbelieve or doubt or even shout or leave it in your mouth
cause how you gone reason wit grand mother nature
running mother earth controlled by father time who's the chaser
it's living and dying homey
laughing and crying dude
trying or lying my brother
walking or flying fool
now half of you are gone find the time to shine
the other half gone find crime money weed wine
till it's to late in a disillusion state of mind
i just found my peace of mind
now they want a piece of mine
to late in a disillusion of mind
the orthodox is the unorthodox they just got you on the names
the insane and the sane are the same
it's a damn shame so many people's aim is so lame
and their gain is so minimal
caught up in the subliminal
it's pleasure and pain water for the flames the wild and the tame
the style still remains if you use the right side of your brain
instead of going against the grain
you can penetrate the vein to the point where what remains is a stain
of this universal thang
that we call balance balance",2
4,"gather around gather around
we are about to spark this potential energy
and we gonna channel it to one source
because the energy can and will be dictated
in any direction in any situation
any which way any one shall choose
right now since i'm the center of this energy
i choose to make it positive energy
and as for the negative energy
i'm gonna overpower the negative energy
because i know it's out there and it's like a disease
and see once my light magnifies the disease dies
ya understand once my light magnifies the disease dies
the energy

yeah disease can't fight oxygen and light
i box 'em in so tight nowhere they gon' go
and jiggawatts is low they won't know what hit em
i warn em then i let the energy submit em
police yourself increase your wealth
so you can live longer and stronger for real doe


i don't know what you subject to
but i suppose it ain't a bed of roses
and neither is mine so let the energy combine
there's strength in numbers there's no need to wonder
or slumber or blunder
from the land down under the pipe storms drain
wouldn't hurt so good but it's not pain
i mean it hurts so good but it's not pain
i said it hurts so good but it's not pain
just the electric charge comin' from the mainframe
and my main aim to dig through the dirt stay alert
insert the power cord so my energy will work
pure energy spurts sporadic automatic
mathematic melodramatic -- acrobatic
diplomatic charisssssmatic
even my static asiatic
microphone fanatic 'alone
blown in in the whirlwind
eye of the storm make the energy transform
and convert introvert turn extrovert
assert myself to eliminate the hurt",2

are you going to tell?
you're new to the trail

the more i look around the more it hurts x5

untampered with time

i keep it refined i speak and i grind

we all hurt sometimes don't we?
we all get hurt sometimes don't we?
we all laugh sometimes don't we?
we often pass the time don't we?
we all get mad sometimes don't we?
we all can flash at times can't we?
have some piece of mind?
don't we need to seize the time? don't we?
life is fucked up
but it can be
some people just lucked up
because they can see
the shit is chaotic in disguise
guns and narcotics for or demise

they pump you with

just a hop skip and jump
away from a rock hit and a drunk
no loitering here
aye y'all can't hang out after dark here
excuse me sir but you can't park here
i mean tell your dogs that they can't bark here

you gotta just let it go

if you knew what makes me tick
it'll probably make you sick
lay my days of my life in front of you
and i'll let you take your pick
come on
pull back the curtain but make sure that you are certain
that it will be worth the energy that you end up exerting
now walk past the doorway step in the foyer
don't you bother knocking
i'm a grandfather clockin' everything you do
i'm seeing through you faultiness
so sprinkle me but not with saltiness
the ghetto taught me this
i fought for this i fight for this i spend my life for this
and if you put your brain to work it ain't hard to decipher this
counting down the days boy closer to your doom
time keeper for the reaper the family heirloom
like staring at my grandfather clock inside my room
it'll never miss a tick-tock it strikes everyday a noon
every hour on the hour it'll sing a tune
every half hour ot'll croon and yell out at the moon
you can't escape the master time no one is immune
the hands of time will grab you when the moments opportune

no one is immune
when the moments opportune

carved from a tree trunk bark
what a wonderful work of art
well i usually wear my sundial
but it don't work when it's dark
don't work when it's dark
no electric parts spark as mechanical as he is
he'll kindly say just wind me and then show me where the key is
then i go about my day and i flow about the way
he never has nothing to say he just sits there on display
i seen one in the cafe one inside the cabaret
timekeeper for the reaper what a pretty price to pay



so don't you bother knockin' at i'm a grandfather clokin'
everything you do i'm seeing through your masquerade
at midnight you will hear the serenade and don't you be afraid
it's like clock work orange lemonade with the bottomless glass
when it's time for that ass
tick-tock
my grandfather clock goes
tick-tock 3x
the pendulum is swinging and it just don't ever stop
tick-tock
my grandfather clock goes
tick-tock 2x
my grandfather clock

i used to have this coo-coo clock
that would bother my grandfather clock
never gave it no rest so i flew over the top of the nest
and then at my request i ask him to resign
he was never on time one hour behind
at ten he stuck at nine
but he did not fuck with mine 'cause i murdered that machine
if you ever beat the clock you know exactly what i mean
exactly what i mean
i hold my grandfather clock in high esteem
my alarm clock screams 'cause he knows how long it takes me
but my grandfather clock leans over and he shakes me
and they both race against time to see who will be
the first to wake me
but when i became awoke my alarm clock was broke
and my grandfather clock was staring right down my throat
and he leaned a little bit closer and he told and i quote
if you ever race against me you will surely come up short
he said i'm better than your timex your rolex or your swatch
your fossil casio quartz your diamond studded watch
he said i control how long you stay alive
i'ma tap you on you shoulder at eleven fifty-five
when the time arrives and then and only then
you'll have your five minutes of funk
i said my final salutations as i stepped amongst the monks
then he took me exactly where i stodd like he should
and i tried to reason with him and i tried knocking on wood
but he said",2

on the nineteenth day of october at one am

no but like a sight
well not exactly like a sight but more like a dream
yeah like a daydream
like two scenes short of a nightmare
except i wasn't scared
looking at the lines of these mean mugs
extremely super beamed up drugged
induced with extra juice in their jugs
try'na hold a tight hug
to tonight's pocket rocket


with a flicker of a spark in their eye socket plugs
my shoulders shrugged as to the meaning of this encounter
trying to find something to read into
what's this going to lead into?
a lesson or just another brother confessing?
either way he's expressing mind
but i was pressing for time
now show me some type of sign that your words are divine
but he just stood there
speechless
choked up
his talk box all broke up
with no real use of his god giving any more just living

when they could walk into the vastness of their brains",2

come here
let me holler at you face to face
see ace been place to place
i seen a million of em
they look at me for a split second
then they grin never to be seen again
but it's locked in so i can read every line
its written all over your upside down mind
with an upside down smile
whoops upside your head well hey now
i never forget a face especially your's
because the mirror is the only dimension without flaws
i look out till again

'cause i done been face to face with a serpent
demon is the same think it is when it ain't
white like snow or black like coal
yellow like the moon and red read like a book
to live or die is the plot but the face is the hook
so meet the face from left field
3 eyes two ears one nose and a grill but still remain faceless

oh ya

let me holler at you face to face
see ace been place to place
i seen plenty of em
but don't let the face fool ya
there's so many of em but still remain faceless
let me holler at you face to face
see ace been place to place
i seen plenty of em
but don't let the face fool ya
there's so many of em but still remain faceless

so can i take a poloroid? -say cheese-
of the face that got you employed -please-
same face your momma enjoyed as a boy
will be the same face that will get you destroyed
now you got to face the facts face the music
you cannot about face it and turn back when you abuse it
so wisdoms use it wise bat thoses eyes show them teeth
lick them lips even powder them cheeks


so while your passin' i'm askin' myself
i wonder if she knows what i'm looking at
well look at that a face that got me looking back
i can see the history in your bone structer
i can see the misery in your frown
so smile now and cry later
or just walk around with the face of a clown and still remain faceless

i said smile now and cry later
or just walk around with the face of a clown and still remain faceless

let me holler at you face to face
see ace been place to place
i seen plenty of em
but don't let the face fool ya
there's so many of em but still remain faceless
let me holler at you face to face
see ace been place to place
i seen plenty of em
but don't let the face fool ya
there's so many of em but still remain faceless

do you know how far a face can take you?
it can make you or break you or inflate you
they're either going to love you or hate you
or never notice you if you're a face they don't relate to
you fear my face don't wanna get near my face
you get judged by your mug they didn't hear your case
now face the wall -face the wall-
your face is against the law
you look at me i look at y'all
i recelect everything i saw in the face of the prowl
but i'm just another face in the crowd -just another face in the crowd-
to figure that at face value is not allowed
tell it to my face and tell it to me now
tryin' to mad dog but you got the face of a puppy dog
like a puppet just like a baby doll
ain't that right baby face? cutie pie?
good lookin' twinkle in your daddies eye?
and then scarface replied i was born with a face i can't hide
-a face i can't hide- a face full of pride
a face that's been denide on sight
i reconize the face but the name slips by
but still your not faceless

they hunt for you they hunt for me
the hunter and the hunted
they hunt for you they hunt for me
the hunter and the hunted
they hunt for her they hunt for him
the hunter and the hunted
they hunt for us they hunt for them

whenever i'm awake i look out
never know when i'll get took out
the hunter likes to sneak behind you
waiting just to undermind you
any chance he'll get he'll blind you
anywhere you go he'll find you
there really is no other op-tion
caught up in the new contrap-tion
to get away is the objec-tion
he smells the scent of your attrac-tion
the predatore will get the prey
pray for your life that you get away
weigh out the pros and then the cons
confusion will just lead you on to the slaughter by the hunter

the hunter and the hunted
they hunt for food they hunt for fun
the hunter and the hunted
they hunt to see the hunted run
the hunter and the hunted
they hunt the strong they hunt the weak
the hunter and the hunted
a friendly game of hide and seek

the hunt is better than the kill real
close your eyes and try to feel the steal
cold metal to your grill kneel


wish it was a sleeping pill peel
his wig and watch watch his blood spill dead
the hunt is better than the kill they said
the hunt is better than the kill they said
the hunt is better than the kill
the hunt us the thrill and the kill is just the reward for the chase
you never get to see his face you race
you get away but you leave a trace a clue
the fox is smarter than the hound true
that's exactly why they hunt him down caught
you hear his little heart pound fear
murder on the battle ground dead
the head hunter takes the head
yeah he was meant to die before he fled ha ha ha

a good hunter don't hunt for the kill
a good hunter hunts for the hunt
now that's a perfect hit right there
that's a perfect shot
that's a clean kill right to the heart see that

the runner running from the gunner
the gunner's gonna wanna
kill him when he see em
done away with
almost captured one of these days i will master the get away
got away clean i mean
there's not a way out
i mean no means no hide aways no routes
what's this about the hunt
what's this about the hunter
what's this about the hunted
now some will hunt to stay alive and survive
others hunt to kill a tribe and divide
you can be on either side of course
extinction in the hunters eye no remorse",2
17,"as i awaken
born from the slums and taken
through the ritual childhood puberty adulthood maturity
and mastery of me
and my surroundings counting down the days till i'm exposed
i hear it move swiftly underneath the nose
till one day you're face to face you're gonna cross the line
you're lost for time
life lose diminished
heart beat finished replenish
now you can be one with the light
but when it comes it'll come like a thief in the night

so hollow the ground and don't put up a fight
'cause when it comes it'll come like a thief in the night
yeah obey the laws and do everything right
but when it comes it'll come like a thief in the night
for real we take 'em away
they take 'em away
we take 'em away
they take 'em away
we take 'em away

i hear the sound of the rain trickling down my window pane
it stains the seal to let me know life is real
sustain and build and and maintain a force field
i use it in a time of need when it's hazzardest
as it is said
be defensive at all time for instance
as soon as i'm elevated out of existence
i am no more
i can soar
right on the back of an eagle
or look eye to eye with a beetle
but now i am engaged
in none other than the physical form in which i'm caged
such lawlessness involved in this charade
tainted face painted black
is that the end momma? can't i come back? 
no your train stops here
right where the rain drops appear


next stop inbetween the ears
objection to make you cirular
work you just enough so you can work yourself


overly anxious can't just wait
to see when death is gonna pull you to your fate
it's inevitable there's no escape
there's no mistake
every time a life is given it's another one you have to take
then your electricity and and your energy's released
born into another soul after your physical's deceased
may you forever rest in peace
although your current is concurrent there is no deturrent
you will cease to be no more
the war has been won
the warrior is rested and your duty here is done
just when you think you're having fun
it'll snatch you up and run
for a second you appreciate the sun
for a half a second you appreciate the stars
for a half a second you reflect on who you are
and what you where
and in a flash it's all a blur


ladies and gentlemen today's subject is death
the way i look at it it's three basic elements right?
die dying dead right? die dying dead death becomes you says the crow to
the cheetah because you're an old cat see you seem a little under the
weather while me my wings are as strong as ever he says
well that may be so the cheetah says to the crow but you know where to
find me because everybody gets their time card pulled you'll just be a few
more steps behind me and behind you may i remind you so is everything that's
true and living that's life driven is given a final shock boy frankly
speaking everything in here is on the clock boy every atom organism
insect animal man is gonna die dying dead death becomes you says the
armadillo to the crow oh you oh you are gonna die",2

wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
a corny lookin' white boy scrawny and always ornery
'cause i was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
and i might snap one day just like that
i decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
my first day in junior high this kid said
it's you and i three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die
i looked at my watch it was 120
i already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?
he said don't try to run from me you'll just make it worse
my palms were sweaty and i started to shake at first
something told me try to fake a stomach ache it works
i screamed ow my appendix feels like they could burst

way before my baby daughter hailey
i was harassed daily by this fat kid named d'angelo bailey
an eighth grader who acted obnoxious 'cause his father boxes
so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
one day he came in the bathroom while i was pissin'
and had me in the position to beat me into submission
he banged my head against the urinal till he broke my nose
soaked my clothes in blood grabbed me and choked my throat
i tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
but he just wouldn't leave he kept chokin' me and i couldn't breathe
he looked at me and said you gonna die honkey
the principal walked in what's going on in here?
and started helpin' him stomp me
i made them think they beat me to death
holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
then i got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
grabbed some sharp objects brooms and foreign tools
this is for every time you took my orange juice
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
i'm gettin' you back bully now once and for good
i cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as i could
and beat him over the head with it till i broke the wood
knocked him down stood on his chest with one foot
made it home later that same day
started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray
i couldn't even see what i was tryna to read
i went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
my mother started screamin' what are you on drugs?
look at you you're gettin blood all over my rug sorry
she beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
i picked it up and screamed look bitch what have you done?
oh my god i'm sorry son shut up you cunt
i said fuck it took it and stuck it back up in my head
then i sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

brain damage ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on
they say i never knew which way i was goin'

life by marshall mathers
what is life?
life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down and every time you think you gotten past it it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
what are friends?
friends are people that you think are your friends but they really your enemies with secret identities and disguises to hide they true colors
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
what is money?
money is what makes a man act funny
money is the root of all evil
money'll make them same friends come back around swearing that they was always down

if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

take you on jerry springer and beat your ass legally
i get too blunted off of funny home grown
'cause when i smoke out i hit the trees harder than sonny bono oh no
so if i said i never did drugs
that would mean i lie and get fucked more that the president does
hillary clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
i ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet bitch
my nerves hurt and lately i'm on edge
grabbed vanilla ice and ripped out his blonde dreads c'mere motherfucker
every girl i ever went out with is goin' les'
follow me and do exactly what the song says
smoke weed take pills drop outta school kill people and drink
jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
i'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
so i'm dumb enough to ask a for date with lauryn hill
some people only see that i'm white ignoring skill
'cause i stand out like a green hat with an orange bill
but i don't get pissed y'all don't even see through the mist
how the fuck can i be white? i don't even exist
i get a clean shave bathe go to a rave
die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
my middle finger won't go down how do i wave?

me and marcus allen went over to see nicole
when we heard a knock on the door knock must've been ron gold
jumped behind the door put the orgy on hold
killed 'em both then smeared blood on the white bronco we did it
my mind won't work
if my spine don't jerk
i slapped garth brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
i'm not a player just an ill rhyme-sayer
that'll spray an aerosol can up at the ozone layer psssssssh
my rap style's warped
i'm runnin' out the morgue
with your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch scream
jumped in a chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
and beat up foghorn leghorn
with an acorn
i'm about as normal as norman bates
with deformative traits
a premature birth that was four minutes late
mother are you there? i love you
i never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel evil laugh
will someone please explain
to my brain
that i just severed a main vein
with a chainsaw and i'm in pain?
i take a breather and sigh either i'm high
or i'm nuts 'cause if you ain't tiltin' this room neither am i
so when you see your mom with a thermometer
shoved in her ass then it probably is obvious i got it on with her
'cause when i drop this solo shit it's over with

hey yo
this song is dedicated to all the happy people
all the happy people who have real nice lives and have no idea whats it like to be broke as fuck



i feel like i'm walking a tight rope without a circus net
poppin' percocet i'm a nervous wreck
i deserve respect but i work a sweat for this worthless check
'bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt

minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
full of venom and rage especially when i'm engaged
and my daughter's down to her last diaper it's got my ass hyper
i pray that god answers maybe i'll ask nicer

watchin' ballers while they flossin' in their pathfinders
these overnight stars becoming autograph signers
we all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
along with the small-fry's and average half-pinters

but player haters turnin' bitch like they have vagina's
'cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
snakes slither in the grass spineless

that's rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

that's rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

my life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
i'm hoping things look up but there ain't no job openings
i feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
livin' in this house with no furnace unfurnished

and i'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
and i'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
but fuck it if you know the rules to the game play
'cause when we die we know we all going the same way

'cause it's cool to be the player but it sucks to be the fan
when all you need is bucks to be the man
plus a luxury sedan comfortable and roomy in a six
but they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics

who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of cess a day
and yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
my daughter wants to throw the ball but i'm too stressed to play
live half my life and throw the rest away

that's rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

that's rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

there's people that love me and people that hate me
but it's the evil that made me this backstabbing deceitful and shady
i want the money the women the fortune and fame
if it means i end up burning in hell scorching in flames

if it means i'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name
this lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'cause right now i feel like just hit the rock bottom
i got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em

i'm screaming like them two cops when 2pac shot 'em
holding two glocks i hope your doors got new locks on 'em
my daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em
and them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em

and while you flaunt 'em i could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
i got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em
'cause i never went gold off one song
i'm running up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

that's rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

that's rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

that's rock bottom",2

round and round
but i wish it would stop and let me off right now

yes man
as the world turns
we all experience things in life
trials and tribulations
that we all must go through
when someone wants to test us
when someone tries our patience

i hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
outsiders baby and we suing the courts
cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source

they never should've booted me out of reform school
deformed fool takin a shit in a warm pool
so they threw me out the ramada inn
i said it wasn't me i got a twin oh my god its you not again

it all started when my mother took my bike away
'cause i murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
after that it was straight to the 40 ouncers
slappin teachers and jackin off in front of my counselors

class clown freshman dressed like les nessman
fuck the next lesson i'll past the test guessin'
and all the other kids said eminem's a dishead
he'll never last the only class he'll pass is phys ed

maybe true till i told this bitch in gym class
that she was too fat to swim laps she needed slim fast who me?
yeah bitch you so big you walked into big tanny's and stepped on jenny craig

she picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
put me in the headlock then i thought of my guinea pig
i felt the evilness and started transformin rarrrr
it began storming i heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming

grabbed that bitch by her hair drug her across the ground
and took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
sorry coach it's too late to tell me stop
while i drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop

as the world turns
these are the days of our lives
these are the things that we must go through
day by day

we drive around in million dollar sports cars
while little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
outsiders and we suing the courts
cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source

hypercondriac hanging out at the laundry-mat
where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
dressed like a sailor standin by a pale of garbage

i met a slut and said what up its nice to meet ya
i'd like to treat ya to a faygo and a slice of pizza
but i'm broke as fuck and i don't get paid till the first of next month
but if you care to join me i was bout to roll this next blunt

but i aint got no weed no phillies or no papers
plus i'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
so gimme all your money and don't try nothin funny
'cause you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to out run me

i went to grab my gun
thats when her ass put it on me
wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
i fell through the glass doors started causin a scene
then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine

jumped up with a broken back
thank god i was smokin crack all day and doped up off coke and smack
all i wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
now i wanna kill her but so i gotta catch her first

ran through alleys parkin lots and took a shortcut
saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin porch up
kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
looked around the room that's when i seen the bedroom door shut

i know you're in there bitch i got my gun cocked
you might as well come out now
she said come in its unlocked
i walked in and all i smelled was liz claiborne
and seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn

she said come here big boy lets get acquainted
i turned around to run twisted my ankle and sprained it
she came at me at full speed nothin could stop her
i shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her

i started to beg no please let go
but she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll
with one leg left now i'm hoppin around crippled
i grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple

just trying to buy me some time then i remembered this magic trick
den den den den den den go go gadget dick
whipped that shit out and aint no doubt about it

i shouted now bitch lets see who gets the best
stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death ahh ahhh

i reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
you know there's a story behind that there saloon
twenty years ago two outlaws took this whole town over
sheriffs couldn't stop em
quickest damn gun slingers i've ever seen
got murdered in cold blood
that ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home
they say the ghosts of bad and evil still live in that tavern
and on a quiet night
you can still hear the footsteps of slim shady and royce da five-nine

eminem
i don't speak i float in the air wrapped in a sheet
i'm not a real person i'm a ghost trapped in a beat
i translate when my voice is read through a sismograph
and a noise is bred picked up and transmitted through royce's head aahhh

trapped him in his room possessed him and hoist his bed
till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
told him each one of his boys is dead
i asked him to come to the dark side he made a choice and said

royce
who hard? yo i done heard worse
we can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
to see which one'll swerve first
two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
that of a globe on top of nine other planets

kissed the cheek of the devil
intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
dismissal i'm not a fair man disgraced the race of a atheist
intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot

one track sliced without swords i buried the christ corpse
in my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
and stay over-worked its like the nazis in the nations collaborating
attemptin to take over the earth

eminem
cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil
we hit the trees till we look like vietnamese people
he's evil and i'm bad like steve segal
above the law cuz i don't agree wit police either shit me neither

we ain't eager to be legal
so please leave me wit the keys to your jeep eagle
i breathe ether in three lethal amounts
while i stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle

releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
he's insane no i'm not i just want to shoot up and i'm pissed off
cuz i can't find a decent vain

royce
the disaster wit dreds
i'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
to kill my soul after i'm dead
when in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
cuz i serve any stranger wit money

i spray a hundred man until they joint chains
while slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
piss on a flag and burn it murder you then come to your funeral
serve this lobbyist strangle your body then confirm you

whippin human ass throwin blows crackin jaws
wit my fists wrapped in gause dipped in glue and glass
i'm blazin mc's at the same time amazin mc's
somehow mc's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me
from all of angles of us flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche
and bust till volcanoes errupt

phone rings

i could walk around straight for two months with a buzz

my brain's gone 
my soul's worn my spirit is torn

i'll hang you 'til you dangle and chain you at both ankles 
and pull you apart from both angles 

i wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins 
and bust open like broken water mains 
so tell sadam not to bother with making another bomb 
'cause i'm crushing the whole world in my palm

so big my entire arm's a giant fire bomb 
buy your mom a shirt with a slim shady iron-on 
and the pants that match here mama try 'em on

i'll tell you one thing
you'll never catch me fronting

a plus but not for drama or fashion
i'm stacking cash until i can get moms a mansion

a plus nah man there's many plans

it started all from impressing the fans

creating the bump is our only incentive
and it's been a long time since i feel i've been felt
but the only thing i fear is fear itself
so you know what we gots to do
maybe could we keep it within the crew
like it should be?

utterly hovering over other things material
you're stuck in the here and now
plus you're sweating profusely -- here's a towel
your fears are now reality
when i take your dream states
and elaborate on how your team's fake
with phony ids but sometimes i feel like

life is a blast when you know what you're doin'
best to know what you're doin' 'fore your life get ruined
life is a thrill when your skill is developed
if you ain't got a skill or trade then shut the hell up

verse one
my rhymes is like droppin' your head on cement
crackin' it open hopin to make a dent i'm hell-bent on
resurrection per-fection
lesson #1 rekindle the essence
rap ain't about bustin' caps and fucking bitches
it's about fluency with rhymin ingenuity
all of this is new to me see i peep rhymes
with scrutiny under a microscope i walk a tightrope
a thin line between insanity and sanity
mixed with a little vanity boostin the morality
with hiero hospitality soon to strike it rich
like calories salaries ah sounds like a plan
and i will expand hip-hop as well
might even kick a little impromptu to stomp you
weaklings speaking things foreign to the human ear
that you will fear now whether you like it or not
blood clots on you little life on the situation
and on the stipulations the shit you wastin
time on you pawns it was planned like that
but we can fight back like david horowitz
and say we want no more of this
and put it in a cyrogenic status
replace it with the lastest in technology
hip-hop policies that demolish ya folliew
olly olly oxen free get off of me
you can't see this your defeatist attitude'll
get you nowhere fast i tend to my task cause

verse two
don't even start on the next man let's scan
your situation you still have no patience
flip on niggaz rob niggaz even family
all the way up to your moms - you can't stand to be
in the house but when you kicked out you beggin
to come back in then the same old skit happens
you say you rappin' but you don't know the essence
just hoe slap and bustin' caps is your message
plus every time i put some scrill down you steal it
if that's your way of teachin me a lesson i don't feel it
your raps reflect your life and that's a shame
cause the way you're soundin you must think that it's a game
i can see if you came from the ghetto but you came
from the meadow - you really need to let that go
you got no respect for hip-hop and you tryin' to rhyme
biding your time and i find it a crime
i even tried to bury the hatchet man
'cause we all african you wanna be a rapper
start practicin you can't even flow right
spend most of your time fuckin' hoes gettin' in fights
hangin' out with no mission in life
and you're missing your life and you'll be missing out on life
i won't sweat you for that g you stole
'cause if you're still alive i'll be there to see you fold
told ya

verse three
you could be a rapper an acto a gun clapper
a comedian providing laughter as a bachelor
a pastor of a chapter a doctor a lawyer
a fireman a hired hand whether boy or girl
it's your world your future you control it
whatever you do early on is how you mold it
i record it sold it told it to you
mr del wouldn't tell you nothin' that ain't true because

think you're able to label the hiero sound?
you still haven't found a comparable variable

we eat emcees outdo and surpass em

verse one casual
boy you touchable
no need to get apologetic
get your bottom dollar bet it
it's your problem i'm a let it
alone the high priest on the microphone
taking historical lyrical oracles to the dome
my rap is blessed miraculous
in fact the impact is just spectacular
intact with the knack to bust butts
need i discuss?
my rhymes make your brain freeze like slush
or slurpees with unpredictable bumps like herpes
lets see if you can serve these superb emcees
all you thirty-third degrees
i've figured out history's mysteries
my kinetic energetic poetic motion
subsides your synthetic notion
of being the best fully pressurized
back up off the microphones i suggest you guys

verse two casual
i'm the epitome of shit we be trying to do
when we go and write a rhyme or two
you need some competition?
boy you better find my crew
we make clean cuts like a diamond do
inclined in the mind
and the beat hit with perfect timing too
when i come to your community
i'm flexing diplomatic immunity
protection connection
legalize mp5's just to tear up your section

back in your system with extra strength
the eternal energy interaction
got me developing quicker and
you in a predicament

politicians still wishing we would take
their prescription for death
got my trigger finger itchin to grab the mic
dishing the truth and the magic
bust with magnum force
and advance forth

verse three pep-love
we got to fertilize the soil
actualize the turmoil
then sift through the facts and the lies
the world and the war is intense
but i remain relaxed in my intents and actions
my lyrics are bottomless pits
now they got the red dot on us
is it a hit?
we escaped every plot on us
watch as we aviate on tape
and make a statement with what we create
just wait till the tide break or dust settle
my ? vibrate and if i must bust metal
adjust the level
release the clutch of the devil
while i conduct this concerto
traveling the ruckus to bring justice
ring through abyss
and bliss'll overwhelm you
now that we at the helm
you don't quit
we go into a realm you never been
and seldom conceived
perfection achieved",2
9,"you best to watch yo knot if
the styles get chaotic
niggaz'll plague me bubonic
but when i move on it
they stay free
feet no hands at least
and say peace
'cause it's lethal when released
defending? please
watch me slice these cheesy mc's
with 5 ounces of milky smooth enrichment
each encroachment's intolerable
i'm too committed and these flows is volatile
wither with other music in it and this
industry in a sense is lost
and my only guidance is inner sense and energy
enervating
what i'm saying will bust your innards
innovating
that's why implicating us as winners
there's no mistake emerging sole victorious
an urgency felt in every flow we bust
with surgeon reminiscent precision
even around the contours curves and incursions
we gettin' in visual gettin' busy
more so than aunt kizzy's
more so than bout any mc that touch mics
what that look like what that sound like?
i'll give you a second
cause ain't no description sufficient
for how we wreckin on records i recommend
i rack and ruin all encompassable
with a position at our beckon and call
butt naked ball i bare it to y'all
for you to stare at

emitted from my tongue leaving fans sprung

intro/chorus x2

all nightin all dayin crusadin
invadin tryin' to find out who's satan
hieroglyphics on the conquest move makin'
for the holy mic you takin'

a man dies once but a coward dies a thousand deaths
man you must know how to step with no power left
those words are words of the prophetess of the powerless
as she professed we became incensed set up on a quest
totally entrenched in every flow that we dispensed
any foe'll be a cinch 'cause we know that we been sent
by the divine universal mother and father to rhyme
you pre-millennium mc's are far behind
so we off to find the holy mic it's only right
hieroglyphics mics of the round table can hold it tight
keep it stable collectin scriptures and secrets
projectin the cohesive beam like graviton
with the avalon hiero is dope ask god
and evil-doers on the mic you have done your last fraud
this ain't no practical joke or anti-factual hoax
but something each breath in my avioli sacs'll promote
opposing mc's will be stomped in the process or taken hostage
until it is accomplished and you can't stop us
draw down the drawbridge cross the moat let's go
hieroglyphics adventures in the twilight zone

a-plus
rumor has it in a far away land
the enemy's partly a devil and he's partly a man
now we on a crusade and i got a new blade
from the blacksmith plus some chainmail that fits my frame well
three knights walking knights stalkin for the holy mic y'all
sun up to night fall
despite all efforts from the sacrilegious interlopers
mountains snows swamps even bridges we will venture over
we were amazed it took
only a mere three hundred sixty days on foot
now we better be brave 'fore we enter the cave
if we don't our people will either be dead or be slaves

tajai
i've got a vague feeling he's here somewhere
feeding off rage villiany tears and fears
hob nobbin with hobgoblins drinkin' blood out of golden goblets
waitin for us to throw the gauntlet
and start some conscience so it can locate then squash us
lest we stay cautious remembered our spells
only kept the strongest on parchment
excellent swordsman and marksmen
who's souls have been tarnished but still escaped the demon's harness
treading intrepantly upon a course
so many mornings noons and nights no snoozing
following the northern lights
does this holy mic really exist?
or is it i'm risking my life following visions?
the knights got my back original is black
i keep thinking that it strengthens my attack
we blaze the final sack tribuning then start up the stone stairs
to the inner sanctum to do our duty

phesto d
we're prepared to shed blood and die as mortals for the round table
if we just happen to get slaughtered depart our coil deep in soil
her royal highness was boiled alive in turpentine
right in line with the serpentine skirt she died cursed
the whole oligarch was torn apart before the dark ages eclipsed the planet
so the holy septum known as the microphone would be in sole control
we'd unfolded the scroll that told us where to go
through the mongols the concrete jungles
slipped in the man from unkle was swashbuckling
beat shuffling acrobatic attack with titanic force
back and forth trading slashes and gashes
the torch dwindled then rekindled with flashes
right again then i put my scimitar right up in em
venom is like a scorpion sting retrieve the age old relic
now i'm back to the round table

you would've been much more than a mouth to feed
but someone i woulda fed this information i read
to someone my life for you i woulda had to leave
instead i lead you to death

i'm sorry for takin your first breath first step and first cry
but i wasn't prepared mentally nor financially
havin' a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me
plus i wanted you to be raised within a family

i don't wanna go through the drama of havin a baby's mama
weekend visits and buyin j's ain't gon' make me a father
for a while bearing a child is somethin i never wanted to do
for me to live forever i can only do that through you

nerve i got to talk about them niggaz with a gun
must have really thought i was god to take the life of my son
i could have sacrificed goi'n out
to think my homies who did it i used to joke about

from now on i'mma use self control instead of birth control
cause $315 ain't worth your soul
$315 ain't worth your soul
$315 ain't worth it

i never dreamed you'd leave in summer
you said you would be here when it rained yo
why didn't you stay?

seeing you as a present and a gift in itself
you had our child in you i probably never feel what you felt
but you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are
through our trials and tribulations child's elimination

an integration of thoughts i feel about the situation
back and forth my feelings was pacin'
happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it
but even that's a lie in less than two weeks we was back at it

is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust
bustin' more than the sweat in somebody you trust
or is it that we don't trust each other enough
and believe havin' this child'll make us have to stay together

girl i want you in my life cause you have made it better
thinkin' we all in love cause we can spend a day together
we talkin' spendin the rest of our lives
it's too many black women that can say they mothers
but can't say that they wives

i wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding
but i want our parenthood to come from planning
it's so much in my life that's undone
we gotta see eye to eye about family

before we can become one
if you had decided to have it the situation i wouldn't run from
but i'm walkin findin myself in my god
so i can discipline my son with my writin'
not have a judge tellin me how and when to raise my seed

though his death was at our greed with no one else to blame
i had a book of african names case our minds changed
you say your period hasn't came and lately i've been sleepy
so quit smokin' the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy

i never dreamed you'd leave in summer
you said you would be here when it rained
you said you would be here when it rained
oh i never dreamed you'd leave in summer
now the situation's made things change things change
why didn't you stay?
why didn't you stay?

i never dreamed you'd leave in summer

you said you would be here when it rained
when it rained it rained

so these streets i strive
like a black panther
asking can the
situation get much worst
all i do is try to appeal to the masses
as the phrase keep it real passes
the teeth of too many phoney individuals
snakes that smooth like criminals
they create chemicals
that the earth hate
doing their damndest to decrease my birth rate
i'd settle for lesser knowing i'm worth wait
or at least my weight in precious gems
so i'm steadily steadly steadly
trying to lose my religion like r e m
created in his own image so are we him?
and through all this crises
shid shit i wonder where christ is
well he damn sure not in k town or the wild hundreds
where they broadcast gd till the world blow-up
and stone run it
hunted by police for display in state vile cages
come out to make minimum wages
and with a desiese that are contagious
it is fucking outrages
the amounts of black and brown they lock up
but the most high encourages me to put the glock up
and stock up on do for self knowledge
a brother couldn't afford to go to collage
so i had to learn form the school of hard knock
on the hard blocks of the chi

needed some boom for the mental relaxation
it took the last of my loot to make this move troop

i seen a lot of ill shit on my block happen nightly
east new york is no joke kid

i went to flatbush to buy incense and weed
stopped at the bookstands for somethin' to read
that shit was rough cause my pockets was bare
and like the sayin' goes sometimes life ain't fair
but in my heart there ain't no quittin
so i stayed up late to write some rhymes to some rhythms
seconds away from just flippin

used to twist dutch masters we got nice weekly
i used to build with the brothers by the spot
they had to hustle but they still knew a lot
to get my haircut had to go to fort greene
on myrtle ave to get a fade with the sides clean
then to fulton just to look around
just to roam around and find a chick to go uptown
and check a movie or some shit like that
i couldn't spend much but yo my game was fat
i remember this one chick she brought me a beeper
then one week later she got me some sneakers
but then i stepped 'cause i found out about her rep
and i ain't goin' out bein no bitch's pet
but anyway i used to lay up in the crib
listening to red and marley wishin i was on kid
saved my dough stayed on the down low
lounged and drank 40's with tommy hill and gunsmoke
and lil' dap used to come by strapped
nice off a l 'cause we stayed like that

felt like a rifle
massage 'n' melodies
might go right through
simultaneously like an uzi
nothin' can bruise me
lyrics let up when lady say don't lose me
so re-load quickly
and you better hit me
while i'm lettin' this fifi get wit me
you steppin' with 007
better make it snappy
no time to do your hair baby
brothers are bustin' at me
beats and bullets pass me
none on target
they want the r hit

quicker the tongue is the trigger
'cause i'm real fast
let off some rhythm at 'em
let 'em feel the blast
penetrate at a crazy rate
this ain't no 38
hit 'em at point blank range
and watch 'em radiate
runnin' out of ammunition
i'm done wit' em
you ask me how i did 'em
i let the rhythm hit 'em

i push a power that's punishable
better be a prisoner
the hit man is the
brother wit' charisma
showing you that i have
powerful paragraphs
followers will become leaders
but without a path
ya mentally paralyzed
crippled ya third eye
rhymes are blurred
then it occurred that you heard i
reduced the friction with crucifixion
let loose the mix then
boost the piston
eric hit 'em with' some of that
cut like a lumberjack
and me gettin' hit back
it won't be none of that
i'm untouchable
you see me in 3-d
when i let the rhythm hit another mc
lyrics made of lead
enters your head
then eruptions of a mass production
will spread when
music is louder
full of gunpower
microphone machinery
when i see a crowd of
party people pumpin'
their fist like this
ya hide in the back
thinkin' that i might miss
but the r is accurate
plus i'm packed up with
educated punch lines that
i have to hit
whatever i aim at
i line 'em up
ya body is weak feel with pain
that time is up
you been hit with somethin'
different isn't it?
rakim is gonna radiate and nothing's equivalent
nothin' can harm me
why try to bar me
you couldn't come around the ra with an army
you'll get wrecked by the architect
so respect 'em
i disconnect 'em soon as i inject 'em
with radiation
put 'em by the basement
bust his chest open
bash his face in
let it split 'im
since he brought his main man wit' 'im
he ask me how i did 'im
i let the rhythm hit 'im
let it hit 'im

packed in like a briefcase
rhyth with ral rough rhyme

the crowd is crucial

now that you're here let me introduce you
get ready
i'm hard read like graffiti but steady
science i drop is real heavy
radiant energy that'll be the penalty
touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
the prescription's one every hour
now it's a habit
ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
attention follow directions real close
keep out of reach of children
beware of overdose
too many milligram
no one made a iller jam
my rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
that kill a man
ideas for the ear to fear
might split 'im
he'll never forget 'im
he'll rest in peace wit' 'em
at least when he left he'll know what hit 'im

was the rhythm

now i'm 'a have to let the style brak
moans now the tone is ingrown
after this here's thrown gimme another microphone
before i get that fifi i met

kiss her 'cause i wanna give her the most respect
so i shine and let the write reflect

eeverything i told her

1,"no omega


i'm the alpha with no omega
beginning without the end so play the
eye inside no extended version
next episode be smooth as a persian
rhyme everlastin there'll be no part two
knowledge is infinite once i start to draw
a better picture for your third eye if you're blind
you know with a mic i'm a black michaelangelo
i'm the brother who id ideas are colorful
givin' 'em insight but givin' 'em trouble to
comprehend 'cause they thoughts won't blend in
they're pretendin while i'm extendin
you bite like a parasite said that it you attacks
but you won't strike cause you ain't no match
you need more light cause yours got dim
then you get sparked by the lord rakim
what's the matter g check your battery
go get charged up then come battle me
you try hard and die hard you ain't eveready
when they check the pulse you'll be dead as freddie
shop at sears for new ideas
check your engine and ask your engineers
to equalize try to disguise it
if that don't work yo then midasize it
you need more power better bring battlecat
but this ain't grayskull and you ain't rippin jack
don't drop the mic and jet for your tooley
bring it to me
we can go rhyme for rhyme till the mic stop the
workin
then i'ma leave you behind the iron curtain
and you'll remain backstage
your book is over i ripped your last page
changed the endin at least you went out rappin'
now i'ma tell 'em what happened
i filled the mic with explosives and lit it up
it was too heavy to hold he couldn't pick it up
pass the mic let him try to get paid
he hit the stage it went off like a hand grenade
now scrape him off the floor and off my list
i ain't a soloist i'm an arsonist
sprayed up he said he was gonna do what?
played up mc grand but pooh-butt
stole his lady and drove her crazy
you asked me why - cause her man tried to play me
i sent her back a nervous wreck
and tried to put her back in check
my speciality is masterin the female species
i specialize in her until she sees
where i come from and why i came
i tame the train till she manifest my name
fill her with life until she burst with energy
then leave her restless cause a lot of women be
tryin' to drain us and leave us stripped dry
put holes in our pocket but you ain't that fly
i clipped your wings and bring you down to earth
and tell you what life is worth
it ain't rings and things that's materialistic
you wanna pip on imperialist with
food for thought 'cause i'm the shelter
i'll be your clothes keep you warm and help ya
not to be hot to trot by a haunt
and why do y'all got to flaunt?
you gotta use what you got
to get what you want
cool i heat you up like a black mink coat
hug your neck like a fat gold rope
words i speak and my dj's cuts will warm ya ears
like mink earmuffs
so eric show 'em how fast your hand'sll go
so the people in the stands'll know
that you don't scratch your cuts in the grave
moves in waves to my rhyme displays
float evoke my tempo jets
expressions express when you kick steps
keep em energetic so let it
pound in your head till what i said is embedded
don't forget it's copastetic set it
anywhere you want your poetry's pathetic
you gets no credit till you get it straight
let's motivate
no intermissions cause it ain't commercial
if you wanna break then i'll reimburse you
i won't let go so my mic won't drop cause
i can't stop
vocabs is endless vocals exist
rhyme goes on so no one can stop this
especially when i start to say the
rhymes with no omega

2,"planet earth was my place of birth
born to be the sole controller of the universe
besides the part of the map i hit first
any a rhyme that i can adapt when it gets worst
the rough gets going the going gets rough
when i start flowing the mic might bust
the next state i shake from the power i generate
people in cali used to think it was earthquakes
'cause times was hard on the boulevard
so i vote god and never get scarred and gauled
but it seems like i'm locked in hell
looking over the edge but the r never fell
a trip to slip 'cause my nikes got grip
stand on my own two feet and come equipped
any stage i'm seen on or mic i fiend on
i stand alone and need nothing to lean on
going for self with a long way to go
so much to say but i still flow slow
i come correct and i won't look back
'cause it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
even the ghetto

i learn to relax in my room and escape from new york
and return through the womb of the world as a thought
thinking how hard it was to be born
me being cream with no physical form
millions of cells with one destination
to reach the best part it's life creation
9 months later job well done
make way 'cause here i come
since i made it this far i can't stop now
there's a will and a way and i got the know-how
to be all i can be and more
and see all there is to see before
i'm called and go back to the essence
it's alot to learn so i study my lessons
i thought the ghetto was the worst that could happen to me
i'm glad i listen when my father was rapping to me
'cause back in the days they lived in caves
exiled from the original man they strayed away
now that's what i call hard times
i rather be here to exercise the mind
then i take a thought around the world twice
from knowledge to born back to knowledge precise
across the desert that's hot as the arabian
but they couldn't cave me in 'cause i'm the asian
reaching for the city of mecca visit medina
visions of neffertiti then i seen a
mind keeps traveling i'll be back after i
stop and think about the brothers and sisters in africa
return the thought through the eye of a needle
for miles i thought and i just fought the people
under the dark skies on a dark side
not only there but right here's an apartheid
so now is the time for us to react
take a trip through the mind and when you get back
understand you're third eye seen all of that
it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
even the ghetto
even the ghetto

no more props i want property in every borough
nobody's stopping me because i'm thorough
rhymes i make gimme real estate for me to own
wherever i bless a microphone
007 is back and relaxing
on point and reactin' and ready for action
i'm so low key that you might not see me
incognito and taking it easy
quiet it's kept on a hush hush
in front of a crowd i get loud there's a bumrush
be calm keep a low pro and play the background
hopin' the wack rapper put the mic back down
so rip it break it in half go 'head and slam it
'cause when it's time to build i'm a mechanic
i'm bonding and mending attaching and blending
so many solos there is no ending
people in my neighborhood they know i'm good
from london to hollywood wherever i stood
footprints remain on stage ever since
as i walk the street i leave fossils and dents
when i had sex i left my name on necks
my trademark was left throughout the projects
i used to get rich when i played celo
when i rolled 4 5 6 they go we know
so i collect my cash then slide
i got my back my gun's on my side
it shouldn't have to be like that
i guess it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
even the ghetto
i'm from the ghetto

3,"see if you can step to this

 eric b cuts up the phrase back to the lab 

now try to do this step back to the lab
and make sure the pace is kept
and this ain't as smooth as i'ma get
nice and easy but hard to catch on to
move with melodies rhymes to respond to
the mic's in front of me so you know it's gonna be
rough and rugged plus i'm smooth as i wanna be
i'm somethin' like sippin on dom perignon
so absorb the song till the rhyme's all gone
my beats and speech original you can't find these
eighty-nine is mine so is the nineties
tellin' you what you need to know and more
you're unsure? on tour i explore
from street to street to speak from beat after beat
my cypher's complete when i build with people i meet
so here's the info straight from the source in fact
paid the cost to be the boss step back
give me room to exercise the mind
three-hundred and sixty degrees'll be fine
the weight of the world is what we hold
that's a six followed by twenty-one zeroes
six ?? sums is a lot of weight
my truth is the strength and my thought won't break
what it take concentration to rebuild our
nation but we got to have mind power
and we can make it work because i know we can
and if somethin' go wrong make another plan
it's up to us so strive and be wise and
when we reach the top don't stop risin'
and i'll keep comin' up with more of
the most requested songs that you all love
reach out and touch the mic take control
still gettin' +paid+ and i still got +soul+
and the only thing i ever wanted you to follow was poetry
mind takes x-rays so listen closely
from the darkness came the light clear out of a dark night
now i'm here to spark the mic
send out truth for other groups and substitutes
with run-on rhymes and weak dubs and loops
they'd rather hear the arsonist they insist
no need to reminisce see if you can step to this

 eric b cuts up the phrase back to the lab 

step back

 eric b cuts up the phrase back to the lab 

 eric b cuts up the phrase
back to the lab without a mic to grab 

so just step

 eric b cuts up the phrase back to the lab 

 eric b cuts up the phrase
back to the lab without a mic 

just step the rhymes create energy
charged up by the cut and it's sendin me
for a trip through the mind so i can locate
a laid back rap at a slow rate
it ain't hard at all 'cause i invented it
as the days go on you hear them with it
brother bustin' braincells thinkin' of a rap
with the same old style we had enough of that
we all need somethin' to step to
and don't forget to 'cause i won't let you
dance without hopin that this come on next
and if it go off the dj can't flex
cause here's the tempo i'ma regulate the pace
here's the step go find some space
and what we gonna do is in unison kick
shake your head you're influenced with music
by now you're intoxicated 'cause i prove i made it
the pep your step so soon you get rejuvenated
from side to side you pause and clap
but if you came to rap step back

here i go again ready to flow again
better hope my mic don't blow again
warned by alarms when the mic gets warm
crowd'll get critical can't keep calm
jet for the exit why hang around?
words that i found make the mic melt down
if you stay better cooperate 'cause i amputate
and whoever don't break i'm-a suffocate
leave 'em with asthma you better pass the
mic to the massacre master who has the
power to build and destoy at the same time
so track the wack at the right and exact could
shine ?
meant to beat overheat but i won't stop
so evacuate the spot when the mic's hot
switch it from one hand to another
and that's a hint my brother run for cover
'cause i'm armed my brain contains a bomb
as if i escaped from vietnam
some people label me lethal lyrics i made then put
beats to
format collapse your lungs twist your tongues
you can't bump your gums off of none of the drums
words that i made'll create an iller scene
eric b is the fly human being on the guillotine
hook 'em up to a respirator 'cause it's the mista
suffocator
what i write is like shovin' a mic down your
windpipe
don't let him bite rhymes rakim write
no mic-to-mouth resuscitation is necessary
no obituary and nothing left to bury
as it strikes on the same mic twice and then
cut it on and i'm-a strike again

then i make rain hail snow and earthquakes
speak the truth tear the roof off the mother
the stage is stompin' grounds -- run for cover

evacuate the building danger 'cause i came to
explain the
strategy that'll be tragic automatically
havin' me to cause another catastrophe
all you gotta do is give rakim the
microphone and the crowd'll yell timber
buildings collapsin' rappers gettin' trapped in
areas closed off no one gets back in
so set up roadblocks barricade the doors
fade put a detour sign on the stage
hold my microphone as evidence the weapon i use
and been usin' ever since
the days in the park when rap was an art then
plus i was dominant determined and dark-skinned
makin' it hard to walk the streets at night
for those who talk the weak beats on the mic
whoever's livin' large better wear camouflage
prepare to be bumrushed when i yell charge
surround by sound of the beat-down another brother
this is stompin' grounds run for cover
wheels or foot better not stay put
whole place shook till the mic's unhooked
then you've got seven minutes to vacate the
premises
lyrics'll echo soon as the break finishes
don't act wild single file to the door
no need for an encore just clear the floor
'cause my mic's about to self destruct
the stage'll blow up when my rhymes erupt
so make sure the place is cleared out and abandoned
'cause minutes from now it won't be standin'
then send out and apb all poets beware of a
brother like me
now how many rhymes could your man manufacture?
how many bitin' mcs can i capture?
trap rappers who try to run off at the mouth
take over their route play 'em out like a cub

try to catch on stay close to the host
and mc's try to make the road rough but i'm coastin
ladies hear the rhymes rub 'em on like lotion
hit spots soothin can't stop movin
go ahead bust a sweat and you can bet i'm still coolin
when i detain it's a brainstorm
never the same form every brain i rained on is warm
takin' a trip through memory lane to melody
see if you could tell if these thoughts to fell mc's
could do you justice but you can't touch this
some kid just tried to bust this but he just missed
i'm universal and much more merciful
so versatile with the style it's reversible
i get away even if i say a curse or two
first let me bust another verse for you
your arms too short to box with ra so quit
you don't want no kind of conflict
or you'll get stripped as the rhyme is ripped
pick up the pieces now ain't that peace yeah i'm hip
everything i said flows since my intro
i plant a thought extend and then grow
holdin' my pen tightly it might be
controversy at first when i write the
chords of research don't just take it for granted
when i'm gone my mind remains a planet
if i keep buildin and teach the children
so when they read in between the lines it's filled in
i break to meditate not a peep concentrate
till i'm deep awake but not asleep
at the same time risin' and advertisin
what is true keep advised and you can stay wise
and i'm untouchable

comin' over the bridge take a peak at the skyline
cause that's how i shine not only when i rhyme
my culture's makin' me stronger mentally
physically i'm powerful poetry now that could be
labelled as art placed in a museum
style'll make scenery now you see 'em
exhibit a knowledge that's packed and filled with
nothin' illiterate it's facts i build with
my mind's untouchable which means intangible
contents never dense it's understandable
i study life so i can live it the right way
no time to hear what another brother might say
why sell a capsule of crack i don't have to
i rhyme and sign million dollar contracts to
put message on records that's graced with hard bass
smugglin microphones this ain't scarface
whoever talked that talk i wanna hawk
and don't try to escape from new york
cross a 110th street lookin' for a problem
it's hell up in harlem watch ra solve em
i hear the music clear as i get near
the hundred and twenty fifth street apollo theater
take a step back when i rap i step up to you
i'm untouchable

put on my thinking cap pump the track
test your reflex relax but in contact
you fold and lose control so hold your partner closer
you're supposed to keep your composure
but you hear the drum said go then it gets so hype
it's like nitro opponents get petro
remember the trademark left by the r
that's never soft or smooth it's comin' off the hardest
in effect you could die-tect the imposter
takin' my props rakim is still proper
i'm a prophet you can't stop it when i drop it
everything i say coincide with the topic
thoughts bounce around till my skull is fractured
inside my brain it's all manufactured
as we go deeper it's hard to find
don't even think about it cause you can't read my mind
it's clear so therefore you need a ear or inclined
in the mind with some kind of idea for
the style i'm advertisin what is true
keep advised that you stay wise and the mind
is untouchable",2
7,"me and eric b was coolin' at the paladium
seen a all-world covered girl i said hey lady i'm
sorry if you're in a rush - don't let me hold ya up
or interveen or interrupt but
you got the look - i wanna get to know ya better
i had to let her know - but yo i didn't sweat her
'cause if you woulda seen what i was seein'
almost looked korean but european
when she spoke her accent was self-explanatory -
even her body language told the story
her name was mahogony - twin's name was ebony
i said my name is ra - and this is eric b
since the music was loud i said let's take a walk
so we could talk and see new york
show time doesn't start until one o'clock
and once i entered your mind i wouldn't wanna stop
caressin' ya thoughts till we was thinkin' the same
calm ya nerves massage ya brain
each moment's a mineral poetry's protein
verse is the vitamin - affects like codine
so tell me how you feel and i'll reveal
a pill that'll heal ya pain - 'cause i'm real
she musta od'd 'cause she couldn't resist
she spoke slowly when she told me this she said

over me i'm goin' crazy
she'll rub me on my chest and call me mr sexy
she said she'd want my kids and help me make my next g
tell me i ain't finesse mahogony

so i prescribed her something to revive and surprise her
she's liver and much more wiser
from the light i shine when the brain cells spark
constantly so she can glow in the dark
then soon you can represent the moon
as long as i keep ya in tune
i'll tell ya who ya are and why ya here
take it in stride 'cause it might take a year
it's funny - how time flies when ya havin' fun
we got close and it was almost one
she kissed me slow but you know how far a kiss can go
fuck around and miss the show
so i told her to hold that thought real tight
we can finish where we left off later on tonight
back to the scene of the crime on time
as they introduced the 'fiend of the rhyme'
she stood in the crowd with a birds-eye view of me
thinkin' of later on of what she would do to me
the back of the room i could see her eyes gloom
patient but hopin' that the show was over soon
as the place was ripped in half she made her way to the front row
so i said let's go
i packed my mic as they screamed for an encore
the speakers were blown plus my mic was sore
besides i got places to go ladies to see
and she could tell me how crazy she was over me
we drove off - she said she liked the way that i performed
and couldn't wait to get 'soft and warm' i said
i was watchin' you watchin' me
looks i received made it hard to mc
i can take a hint so i knew that she
wanted my agony agony ag-on-y in her bod-y
showed her some sights then i took her to the condo
she was pipin' hot but i kept my calm so
she asked how come i don't smile i said everything's fine
but i'm in a new york state of mind
as we reached the kingdom she said bring some
champagne she'll entertain then sing some
sentimental songs real gentle
it hit the spot and you know where it went to
as we embraced i felt her heart pumpin'
i knew she was in the mood for somethin'
so i laid on my back and relaxed
it wasn't the perignon that made her collaspe

over me she was goin' crazy
she'll rub me on my chest and call me mr sexy
she said she'd want my kids and help me make my next g
tell me i ain't finesse mahogony",2

me and the rap's laid back
nonchalant and relaxed in the track
put together well so it ain't hard to tell
easy to recognize so my records'll sell
on the microphone well known with a low tone
show and prove when the stage show is shown
all you hear is screams when i'm hit by the laser beams
ladies fiend rappers are choosin' up teams
so who could beat up just before we meet up
before i kick a rhyme i kick my feet up
to let you know everything's under control
under surveillance takin' over your soul
so let me handle this gettin' scandalous
all my jams are hits never plan to miss
crowd is captured released at my permission
peep em as i keep 'em eager to listen

rakim
opponents are found paralyzed from the mic down
left with a little sight ears still hear the sound
try to clear your mind but it's still there
give him about a year then give him a wheelchair
i damage and deteriorate till your brain dead
no huss cuss what i discuss'll bust his head
here's some hearin aids when your eardrums fail
you get scars so you could read it in braille
close your third eye then i do body work
and i keep the same procedure till somebody's hurt
my dj'll sew up cuts like an md
and i still move crowds like an mc
entertain and tear you out of your frame
leave you in a puddle of blood then let it rain
then i get deep so try to withstand
on my level to think or sink like quicksand
he couldn't hang so i cut the rope short
watchin 'em fall 'cause they need more support
this is the way that i done all of my competition
peep em as i keep 'em eager to listen

keep 'em eager to listen

rakim
the performance i give 'em is somethin' like a hypnotism
swingin' back and forth till you can keep the rhythm
at the tone of my voice you will become
eager to listen dance in a trance till you see the
r on stage no cheers all ears
all three of your eyes on me so it appears
just like you thought it would be but even better
live and direct on stage instead of the
radio or video or studio rehearsin
i'm at my best in the flesh in person
the main attraction center of attention
the crowd'll go crazy soon as i mention
it's time to communicate so let's conversate
i get my point across when you respond i make sense
so now we could continue the mission
as i keep 'em eager to listen

as i keep 'em eager to listen

rakim
i used to always say one day
i'll play in the nba 'cause i'll slay
opponents well and also excel
as a black quarterback in the nfl
i throw to score so i can hear the crowd roar
keep em out of they seats and on the floor
and when i win it'll pump my adrenaline
my record is undefeated and i'll win again
i'll never lose or hear boos from the audience
'cause they participate and applaud me since
i bring 'em what they want to hear
and they'll fill up the atmopshere
with people that came to party and have a good time
so when i'm gone i'm sure you understood the rhyme
because i promise to accomplish the mission
'cause i keep 'em eager to listen",2
9,"rakim
i came to set 'em straight and let 'em know
whoever's holdin' the best just let him go
cause here's the inside scoop on the fiend
they wanna know why i'm seldom seen
cause who needs the tv screens and magazines
or shootin through the city in fly limousines
there's one thing i don't like it's the spotlight
 'cause i already got light
they be like yo we had a get together last week
and we know everyone was there except the black sheik
because my schedule is tight i gotta write
i'm deep in the archives and keepin' 'em hyped
it's been a long time since you heard a strong rhyme
none of these are weak so when you bite on mine
we can trace the hits and then name that style
mc'sll be out of a job for a while
i reposess your indentification
so hand in your application
put your mic on strike until you're unemployed
contract is up and i'm stampin it void
your selection ain't that selective
so i'ma put you in your proper perspective
on the dancefloor and doin' the shake
ready to let 'em brake set 'em straight

rakim
somebody said i set 'em up and pulled the plug on em
but instead i let 'em go on so i could bug on em
go 'head and flow 'cause i close the show
swing a song for the ladies and rhyme real slow
for instance once i commence
 the crowd is convinced
so now you know who to put your money on
hurry up before your money's gone
'cause i'm the most common denominator
orchestrate a rhyme much greater
i'm like a world almanac so tell the media
givin' 'em information like encyclopedia
so bring a dictionary so you can look it up
so you know what i mean when i hook it up
no misconceptions although i complicate
but this concept'll set 'em straight
they even said that i was locked in jail
so now i guess i'm out on bail?
the only island i was on was the strong one
and if i did my bid it'll be a long one
'cause if i sold weight i'd be upstate
in the penile waitin for a brake
cause sellin drugs is for handicaps
i got too many skills besides bustin' rough raps
if i go to jail it won't be for sellin ki's
it'll be for muderin mc's
the beat'll take over your heart then i start
to cut 'em in half cause rhymes are razor sharp
secure the exits all mc's remain
'cause we got a crowd to entertain
and i know when i go i'll flow dangerous
brain'sll bust what you tryin' to explain to us?
you got lost and couldn't go on
came up short so here's one to grow on
elevate off a high iq
in time you'll find i'm true
cause once i start on a piece of art
from sun to moon and light to dark i build the ark
now you can float off the rhymes i wrote
i'm sure that we'll hit shore without a boat
you could bring a battleship and still get shipwrecked
attacked with a torpedo what did you expect?
driftin up the creek without a beat or a paddle
castaway on a raft and stand fragile
rescue your crowd which ain't a hard job
me and my knowledge put together i'm a lifeguard
dealin' with actual facts it sold out fat
here and now but i go so far back
to bring you up to date so we can elevate
it's no time to wait or anticipate
'cause i'm never late i'm gonna motivate
so i can let 'em brake and set 'em straight",2

a mix between superfly snuka and a superhoe

digest a group and sell the poop on ebay

danger with the vest screamin shoot the dj
doom clickin' over two chickens three-way
four in the 5 a cork on the freeway
villain find a way to make 'em pay whatever we say

state your intentions
i really love your tape but i hate your inventions
very well - what you want a brownie?
he took off the mask and whispered put me where you found me

he kept his paper digits in a trunk
once joined a rap click - midgets into crunk
he did a solo on the oboe
coulda sold a million then the villain went for dolo

and cited creative differences
basically they hated he left no jaded witnesses
rappers suck when they spit i doubt 'em
the crap they sing about you'll wanna slap the {fuckin shit} out 'em

psht - time waits for no man
on a blind date a love with a slow chrome hand
judged him by his shoes hot smelly brogan
budged him with the news called him pot-bellied conan

no prick barbarian
a strict bear-atarian a sick pair of merry men
the beat is like a swift kick in the rear end
the stiff {dick} made her lose her lipstick and hairpin

he said djamn  act like you know me
even with the mask on show me what you owe me
tell her brush her grill and wash her face and {twat} homey
dumile got her like inuyasha got kagome

what we have here is a failure to communicate
if you gonna hate might at least get your rumors straight
about doom the great a lot more confident
came a long way since the days we had to rhyme for rent

it was time well spent vented
spelt and dented hell-bented and heaven-scented
a wire is dead he's in it for the cash flow
i'd like to send a big up to firehead lazzo

let a brother know once you lasso hasbro
so when he come with destro he gets no hassle
could hardly get a word in
and wonderin what the damage is to retain harvey birdman?

yo uhh danger  it's me your old buddy shake
ahh i heard you're doin a little project and uhh y'know
i hear you talked to some other people

sofa king

scared of a bunch of water then get out the rain
order a rapper for lunch and spit out the chain
then kick a lungee of the tip of his timbo
trick a honey dip into a game of of strip limbo

odd he couldn't find no remorse
a wink is as good as a nod to a blind horse
of course his technique was from a divine source
never knew the price of ice or what swine cost

one guy tried to bite the heat
that's when he discovered the other other white meat
oh the one they hate so well
he sure keeps it psycho like the old bates motel

they came to ask him for at least some new tracks
but only got confronted by the beast with two backs
knock mouse is a made man
villain laid it down like the best laid plan

bell the cat who the hell is that near the middle
got y'all but it's not all beer and skittles
prepare the vittles got riddles and spittles
crystal clear to the jot or the tittle
tssst it's hot off the griddle
came to take the cake whether it's a lot or a little

kaboom doom is nervous large
you could tell by his blooming room service charge
dark and tall to boot
the only thing was wrong was he was bald as a coot

used to rent a van from peter pan to red and tan
and keep the human foot for his dead man's hand
this was when the mask was brand spanking new
before it got rusted from dranking all the brew

stankin' too pew
kept all his earnings in the bank and a shoe
spat what he knew energy for true
to all fake rappers twenty-three skidoo

excuse you any room in the class front?
for a blast of the blunt shrooming since last month
doom a human in the mask born to stunt
danger zooming past mad fast on the hunt

keep your streets we got the city neatly conquered
discreetly with a cd till they be completely bonkered
the fans demanded it handled it swallow it
his own brand of sht if only he could bottle it

hmm nah she could get messy
feds tried to torture him for the secret recipe
he said it's no use i only know half
no speake de english i only do the math

zzzzzt felt no pain
his brain was saturated with cocaine and rogaine
he said try scan no thing three-card dead fly man
go for bling he got bled
i jam over sting see spots red

he tried to get schoolie with that two for you

one two for me g cut the cranky attitude
wet 'em like a handkerchief or a stanky fatter dude
whether you'se a rapper or a damn singer
once you in there's only one way out like a gang banger

with a new crew key chain and street name
what set do he claim for fame game
just to keep feather and stay dipped
you need it like a letter or better yet a get away whip

this old thing's rusted and crusted as the bowl
rings the old kings busted
planning in global starvation and fat herb
now what in tarnation did i go and do that fer?

stuff happens like getting snuffed for tough tit rappings
see i told him enough quit your yapping
the same apply to any and all chumps
the only question he had for y'all was how many lumps

three or four either or
mon cheri amore so why you need your heater for?
the super villain slid in your party for free
want an mc get out of here kid you bother me

the day i took my mask off
my face was missing for two days
for the record g came back a year later
a whole new identity tony stark's pedigree
my money green like my nickname was celery

who is ghost? he flashed his toast
never wore sheets but bulletproof coats
oh no the feds cried for the mask back on
told them ghost is dead he'll return at the crack of dawn

few years from now him and his pals
before the jetson era arrive
he'll be back summer time 2005
with a half of face iron the other half water look like alien science
in the summer time you can see the face boil
but the other side i keep lubed with the pennzoil
mad loyal when the winter time come
i gets stuck with my brain all numb

like i ate thousand icees and frozen pepsis
aquaman's pops can't water check me
disrespect me indirectly
i seen his feet and they both lefty he steppin' half correctly

as i stroll the globe and terrorize the planet
with a bill clinton mask and them playskool hammers
me and doom always be the best on the landing
superheroes for life until our souls vanish

check me out my name is brak and that's a fact
i got a mom and a dad and they are out back
we're sitting by the pool and we nibble on snacks
and we eat a big lunch and we all take naps

circa one nine seventy-one
on the mic machine it seems his work will never be done

he seeks the ninth level of power
but weak geek might freak it in another hour
or so they call the fool retarded hair guy
in school you could spot it when he nodded here why?

i think his true name was gerald
the toupee the male pattern anime herald
a good laugh like the walk to the bank
not the plank talk to the hand and the hot frank dog

able to shoot electricity through his eyeballs

more interesting than professional wrestling
when he's online you can find him on instant pestering

read the charge and thunk sunk in in a plush padded cell
tempur-pedic craftmatic adjustable

shrink said he thinks he believe he could fly
spread his wings and flap like a goose
he'll show you how to do it if you help him get the straps loose

diagnosed as shell shocked from totin' toast
and still could hear the bells rock doc another loading dose
he claimed he couldn't take the racket
faked his own escape in a eight ball straight jacket

ladies and gentlemen of the jury
this animal here this ursine fellow unclean
he rejected society and retreated
to a cave in the woods to plot his vile nod

and it isn't true that at these times
he often descends into a delusional state
sometimes actually adopting another person's persona?

i started punchin' once i saw son lungin'
he had me put on punishment for eating the last munchkin
so now they got me down here near the dungeon
nurses all arguin' over who's to do the spongin'

he requested time off for bugged behavior
and rhymed off of thug beats bumped by a neighbor
who spoke with his fist and kept a mirror with a thum bhole
cell twelve drumroll ode to a gum sole

and told him take a gold shower for fakin' funk soul power

stocky short and cocky
looked like apollo creed after he fought with rocky
rhymed in a broken english slang not cockney
thirteen his first queen wore hot knock knees

had to tell her pops yo stop cockblockin b
hold somethin' for your daily yay habit
then go bada-bing-bing-bing like ricochet rabbit
how 'bout the sicko say stab it?

there's liquor in the cabinet and a slicker for the crap pit
and heineken i told him much obliged friend
what i gotta spend if i only touch her thighs then?
why his eyes widened
he didn't know your man had a nice surprise hidin'
took pride in ridin' in a sly wiseguy grin

real recognize real
on the microphone the wheels are mechanized steel
please at least respect your ideals
how you got her walkin along the stroll in high heels?
he said her mama was gettin old
god bless her poor soul now no more drama is your role

straight to the head
he know a lot of haters can't wait till he dead
lead to go like a ho to a strange whack housewife
only thing he know will change his back do' how trife

rules is rules don't go there
stay on sale like a old coat made of mohair
keep a snotty chicken on e the lone ranger
why everybody always pickin' on danger?

and doom maybe it's him
called up my lady told her baby it's slim
make me up a margarita i need to take a swim
tell them kids remember school if they let 'em out cool
but get the hell from out the pool

hey {shithead} it's me again
and you know what?  i just heard it's all done now
and somehow i guess you must have lost my number
you know what?  you suck
you suck  your music sucks
and i hate your sucky stupid metal face
i hope you burn you're going down
this is the last big mistake you'll ever make
you suck  i hate your guts

but if there is another project in the future please keep me in mind

scared of a bunch of water then get out the rain
order a rapper for lunch and spit out the chain
then kick a lungee of the tip of his timbo
trick a honey dip into a game of of strip limbo

odd he couldn't find no remorse
a wink is as good as a nod to a blind horse
of course his technique was from a divine source
never knew the price of ice or what swine cost

one guy tried to bite the heat
that's when he discovered the other other white meat
oh the one they hate so well
he sure keeps it psycho like the old bates motel

they came to ask him for at least some new tracks

you could tell by his blooming room service charge
dark and tall to boot
the only thing was wrong was he was bald as a coot

used to rent a van from peter pan to red and tan
and keep the human foot for his dead man's hand
this was when the mask was brand spanking new
before it got rusted from dranking all the brew

stankin' too pew
kept all his earnings in the bank and a shoe
spat what he knew energy for true
to all fake rappers twenty-three skidoo

excuse you any room in the class front?
for a blast of the blunt shrooming since last month
doom a human in the mask born to stunt
danger zooming past mad fast on the hunt

keep your streets we got the city neatly conquered
discreetly with a cd till they be completely bonkered
the fans demanded it handled it swallow it
his own brand of sht if only he could bottle it

hmm nah she could get messy
feds tried to torture him for the secret recipe
he said it's no use i only know half
no speake de english i only do the math

zzzzzt felt no pain
his brain was saturated with cocaine and rogaine
he said try scan no thing three-card dead fly man
go for bling he got bled

rosa parks never a factor when she making ends meet

ash riser
fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

kendrick lamar
and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving a body sore
her anatomy is god's temple
and it's quite simple her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
she's always paranoid watching the law inside the streets
undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
remember the sergeant let her slide said if he seen
what's between her thighs he'd compromise to no surprise
she took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
his eyes was closed shut prior charges he had waived 'em
it was a block away from lueders park i seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
'cause rosa parks never a factor when she topping off police

ash riser
fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

kendrick lamar
and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving a body sore
as she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure
of a black man white man needing satisfaction
at first it became a practice but now she's numb to it
sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
but she never heard of catholic religion or sinners' redemption
that sounds foolish and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her
this mothafucka is the fucking reason why keisha rushing through that
block away from lueders park i seen the el camino park
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters still she hit the back seat
and caught a knife inside the bladder left for dead raped in the street keisha's song

my little sister eleven i looked her right in the face
the day that i wrote this song set her down and pressed play

flagging down all of these flashy cars oh

i believe that all the little secrets people keep
when you drop your guard and slumber they come out and front
i crush to sleep for nothing i'm left to beat the sun

if death and sleep are cousins then justice is disgusting
we'll probably be cellmates behind hell's gates
the devil lives inside my eyelids
when i close them i hit rising violence i'm supposed to find some silence
rockin' the back seat of insomniac theatre
with the answers in the subtitles i just can't read em
i'm right where the fears at fighting the tears back
trying to catch my balance on life before the piers crack
i hear that hate slammin' my own little prison
i declare that ?hate band? my soul didn't listen
so i stare at the crack in the ceiling until the earth go twistin
glare at that little feeling that i've been burdened with its turbulant

i'm a poetry chick magnet
with goldy the pimp habits
i roll with a limb that is
droven omaha flowin' for hick ass kids
knowin' i was zonin' at the moment i hit that shit i love y'all
kris references and no one will get that shit
i even make the best of it and go home and slit my wrists
imagine what a trip it is rappin' for little shits
who think that djin' was created by mr dibbs
remember this those are the main ones that show us support
so i owe them my existence and shit so
i got to thank them my home is broken ain't it?
i downloaded parents 'cause i heard they're overrated
i pushed a demo tape when the group was first created
younger brother was the debut album when they made it
e behind the music believe that i've been through it
i either write the true shit or feel my life is useless
you should do this math with me right quick dog
i count myself to sleep when the lights get soft
tour twice in the spring and the fall
ten weeks each my son doesn't see me at all
9 out of 12 months daddy's gone for 5
spot dates in the mix i'm absent for 6
so i'm a half ass daddy
part time singer
half ass crazy got my wife feelin' half single
in new jersey bitchin' with the word play
about how my parents raised me in the worst way possible
doin' what i gotta do
and tryin' to get a rap or two
missin' my own son's third birthday
i'm a self centered piece of shit
stomped down hypocrite
tryin' to get a grip on it but now i got to live with it
this is me motherfucker i'm a mean mugger
not intentionally brother i was tryin' to see somethin'
i never drive because i'm legally blind
all i can do is describe what i see in my mind
people are fine until they peep a weakness of mine
then they fuck me over so i need to leave them behind
shit's real
my wrist is still stiff from my last hook
cat learned how to scrap just by gettin' his ass whupped
i'll catch an elbow and that shit will just hurt
so i swing mine the next time i get in some dirt
and that works
and that's why murs is the homie
because the brothers ain't scared to dig out spurs in the moment
my recipe for greatness there is no depleting this
because the active ingredient in it is my weaknesses
i speak with this little drawl that the midwest created
when they treat someone like shit for a decade
anthony can't chirp flare or backspin
but he'll listen to my fucked up life without laughin'
i'm challenged and offended by sheets of blank paper

every year new city new rules to play with true shit
new kid in school didn't rule nothing
to this day i rap like i'm trying to prove something
little bit aggressive when i spit a sentence

you couldn't pay me to quit professin'
rock sixty-one sold out shows came home and caught a bus to the

way i maneuver kama sutra give me a statute
so now i ask you and tell you brothers literally
when it comes to hooking up with these ladies y'all ain't better than me
down with rnc endlessly reciting poetry
anytime i'm in the bed my wife is there exploring me
then i no i'm not ready to share my game plan
many say they're free but this style they haven't attained yet

renege you son bumping through dunn don't you know it's your biology to cum
what separates the men from boys masturbation from love making
is making your women really humm
cause by the time you finally get her open she get done
and rock the body then up you gotta run
see only a sucka pull a move like that
then wonder why your women getting hers behind your back
select the right time and place
put it in her face and taste creation of the human race
it's all about the physical built up you created
your time wit it kid and let her escalade

regina got arrested as a late prowler
couldn't trick got evicted lost her section aid voucher
onward goes my neighbourhood's revolving door
a gang of rental properties nobody owns at all
i guess that's why we call it a hood
nobody stays as long as it takes to become neighbour

children growin' women producin
men go workin but what's the use
when the real strive hard and stress about the rent
and can still die poor and in debt without a cent",3
7,"verse one
damn brother what's wrong with you
i think that somebody as strong as you
should have a better memory for what it was that brought you through
i know it's hard for you to discard what's carved in you
and i don't think that's what it is i need to talk to you
i'm not a hypocrite i just forget
and right now the shit i'm livin' with has got me in the thick of it
i'm strugglin'
i can feel my knees bucklin'
but all that sufferin' never made my faith muscles thin
my defense mechanism is inaction
my whole outside world is a distraction
i lose track of what day and week it is
and i forget about is my family of believers
but i with them for ten years and they raised me
it pains me that they ain't been seeing my face lately
my daily prayin' is damn near a special occasion
as a human i neglected my station

ooh child
say why
ooh child
say why
from his hands
clappin' church on sunday mornin'
from his hands
you stay here i don't want it
say baby don't you run so fast
might pound on a piece of glass
put yourself in jesus' hands
c'mon sang

verse two
nineteen years old i used to preach to the people and
teach they children that god's voice was deep within
travel overseas learning how to live and breath
what i believe ain't waterin' my seeds child
i carried my head all off balance
too spiritual to develop raw talents
that brother walk around with his head in the clouds
till real life came and punched him dead in the mouth
brought him out there no where near prepared
not secure enough to admit he was scared
so he flipped the scene
but he
still extreme
and the only thing that changed is his yang became ying
changed in the place where the ?juma? resumed
while he tried to get his crew out the room with a view
those old ladies words still ingrained in his brain
when he prays he remembers their names
please allah don't let my heart get heart get too far gone
or let me die while i'm riding out the groove that i'm on
it's goes ?hebrew?",3
8,"a question was raised to me the other day
why it seem you always have joy?
well i'd like to take time to set the record straight

all the joy i've ever known
has disappeared
- in the motherfuckin thin air
like it's never even been there
my joy left me y'all

god's rain water flow through the same gutter
that we walk today gotta stay brave brother
keep your lips stiff keep your fist clenched
at times you gotta kick your way through this bitch

and i can't stop feelin' guilty smiling
a wise man once told me that every cloud has a silver lining
i wanted to believe him but it's a trick to find 'em
when the people around me continue dying
granddad was in the twilight of his life
when he closed his eyes tight and opened his wrists wide
what make a tenth round fighter with the winning score
decide he need to throw the towel before the whistle blow
maybe i'll never know
but i inherited his poetic soul so the symbolism's yet to show
was life so obscene that death's more serene?
or was an old author tryin' to write his own closing scene?
nothing stings like knowing that the woman that gave me this life
is being eaten from the inside
i thought we never make shit right
i wish i had viewed it once clear before you were done here
that's two in one year that i let leave here
loving me without sheding one single tear
either i'm one of the strongest people left
or y'all should stone me for even tryin' to steal breath

and god's rain water flow through the same gutter
that we walk today gotta stay brave brother
keep your lips stiff keep your fist clenched
at times you gotta kick your way through this bitch

they say shit's strapped but you are by yourself ain't ya?
damn straight i got a jail cell nature
been boxed up but i never been settled in
him got tough started developin leather skin
i learned to make that face that tells predators
it's better to re-assess just who you bout to wrestle with
i'm on one like the first kick drum of the beat
clear my lungs spit blood on the street
they tellin' me we got nuttin to fear but fear itself
but i fear i have no human fear left
some day i'm gonna wanna peel back these calouses
and really feel life again and that's what my challenge is
i been kickin and bitin for so long and
when they throw me a rescue rope i'll be too weary to hold on
and see the light so i sing through the tears
in the key of life the way a wounded eagle might

and god's rain water flow through the same gutter
that we walk today gotta stay brave brother
keep your lips stiff keep your fist clenched
at times you gotta kick your way through this bitch

my joy left me y'all
she don't show her face around these parts
every time she come she get chased off
so she stay distant

if it wern't for him squintin he wouldn't know the sun was out
i hate every word that come outta his fuckin' mouth
ladies treat him special don't know nuttin 'bout him
if they saw what his wife see they wouldn't fuss about him
he can't do shit right but rap and make babies
and babies need daddy at home consistent
but rap keep daddy on the road religious
so even in my two loves my soul's so conflicted
my son came into this world innocent
he deserves everything that he needs to live in it
and this home i made for him is broken
i'm hopin his love for me will never grow thin
it hurts daddy to no end to know when
you're cryin at the hospital i'm out tryin' to rock a show
i made a vow that we'd never be broke again
and i'd never be a burden on another friend
so when i'm sweatin on my farewell stage
and wrote my last hook in my last rhyme book
when i get my last nod of approval from my family
this is the man that i have to be

and god's rain water flow through the same gutter
that we walk today gotta stay brave brother
keep your lips stiff keep your fist clenched
at times you gotta kick your way through this bitch

i feel
like i'm al-most gone",3

them ain't chia pet plants in the crib that's chronic
and i'm sellin them 500 a pop god damn it
i sold everythin' i'ma hustler i know how to grind
step on grapes put in water and tell you its wine
if you analyze me what you'll find is the dna of a crook

what goes in my mind it's contagious
hypnotic it sounds melodic
if the rap was the block or spider i'll be that potent product
now get a load of me flashy far from low key
and you can locate me where ever that dope be gettin' money man


it's a hustler's ambition close your eyes listen see my vision
mossberg pumpin shotgun dumpin and drama means nothin'
it's part of the game catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
in the jewels with your chains
i upgrade from 30 bs to clean vs
rocks that i copped procedes from the spot
i got the energy to win i'm full of adrenaline
played it perf and get nauseous watchin the spinner spin
i make plans to make it a prisoner of the state
now i can invite yo ass out to my estate
them hollow tips bent me up but i'm back in shape
pour cristal in the blender and make a protein shake

that's when you find yourself talkin' to pro tools
there's not too many that ever walked in the loc shoes
or tell the tale that my heart contains
i explain so many different parts of pain
i'm clean but still some marks remain
from the past when that kush weed sparks the brain
the cash made some people start to change
i feel hate when i pulled up and parked the range
your damn right i got rich but my heart the same
and practice makes perfect with the art of aim
you ain't really got the heart to bang

but i'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
instead of a rose there's a hundred dozens of those
see i see something special when i look in your eyes
with your legs way back i say this pussy is mines
if you ain't sure when i'm talkin' i don't tell you no lies
but there's things that you say that have me wanderin' why
when i don't say what i'm thinkin' it don't mean that i'm shy
got on that shit that you picked for me that's why i'm so fly

if i was your best friend i want you round all the time i want you round me all the time
can i be your best friend if you promise you'll be mine girl promise you'll be mine
please say he's just a friend uh huh
now girl let's not pretend come on
either he is or he ain't your man haha
please say he's just a friend
if i was your best friend i want you round all the time i want you round all the time

please say he's just a friend uh huh
now girl let's not pretend come on
either he is or he ain't your man haha
please say he's just a friend
if i was your best friend

while you in your bubble bath i can wash on your back
when you puttin' on your lotion i can help you wid that
i sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
the slang i use when we bill may change how you talk
and if i'm focused when i'm strokin' i can change how you walk
it's the swagger that you come for but when you come from new york
i'm a hustler i just hustle in the things that i bought
separate me from the rest i feel like i'm the best
if there's a price to pay for feelin' you i pay that twice
i'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
i ain't got nutin' to hide baby i tell you my secrets
'for you end up bein' around long enough to peep shit
i get closer to you i mean closer than close
i get into you after i take off my clothes
girl i been into you mentally long before

if i was your best friend i want you round all the time i want you round me all the time
can i be your best friend if you promise you'll be mine girl promise you'll be mine
please say he's just a friend uh huh
now girl let's not pretend come on
either he is or he ain't your man haha
please say he's just a friend
if i was your best friend i want you round all the time i want you round all the time

we were kings and queens never porch monkeys
there was empires in africa called kush
timbuktu where every race came to get books
to learn from black teachers who taught greeks and romans
asians arabs and gave them gold when
gold was converted to money it all changed
money then became empowerment for europeans
the persian military invaded
they heard about the gold the teachings and everything sacred
africa was almost robbed naked
slavery was money so they began making slaveships
egypt was the place that alexander the great went
he was in shock that in the mountains were black faces
shot off their nose to impose what basically
still goes on today you see
if the truth is told the youth can grow
they'll learn to survive until they gain control
nobody says you have to be gangsters hoes
read more learn more change the globe
ghetto children do your thing

[verse 1] - nas

i'm capable of anything my imagination could give me wings
to fly like doves over the streets watchin' many things
kids walkin' home from school on drug blocks missionaries
pass out papers that read love god
i see faces cases judges 'n' jurors masons lawyers 'n' cops
i watch 'cause every thugs face is my mirror
but this was one imparticular
this kid he was the vintage stick 'em up pro
16 years old did his jail since there was no where to go
every mornin' calls his commrad to come 'n' get em' a smoke
he insane already gone mad blames himself for his setbacks
dangerous street corners where his sets at
sling from dusk till dawn detectives act like they maniacs
chasin him his ass was flarin
smokin' like a chimney on remy of course he not carin
he needs a place to go to keep his mind expandin
i give 'em a helpin hand bring 'em out to thugz mansion

every corner every city there's a place where lifes a lil easy
lil hennesey lay back and cool every hour 'cause it's all good
leave all the stress from the world outside every wrong done
will be all right nothin' but peace love 'n' street passion
every ghetto needs a thugs mansion

[verse 2] - tupac

dear mama don't cry your baby boy's doin' good
tell the hommies i'm in heaven and it ain't got hoods
seen a show with marvin gaye last night
it had me shook drinking
peppermint schnapps with jackie wilson and sam cook
then some lady named billie holiday sang
sittin' there kickin it with malcolm till the day game
lil' latasha sure grown tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven
so come home
maybe in time you'll understand only god can save us
where miles davis cutting lose with the band
just think of all the people that you knew in the past that passed on
they in heaven found peace that last
picture a place that they exist together
there has to be a place better than this in heaven
so right before i sleep dear god what i'm asking
remember this face save me a place
in thugz mansion

[hook] wanna go wanna go

[verse 3] - nas

a place where death doesn't reside jus' thugz who collide
not to start beef but to spark trees no cops rollin' by
no policemen no homicide no chalk on the streets
no reason for no body's momma to cry
see i'm a good guy i'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
but if i should die i know all of my albums support her
this whole year's been crazy asked the holy spirit to save me
only difference from me and ossie davis grey hair maybe
'cause i feel like my eyes saw to much sufferin
i'm just 20 some odd years i done lost my mother
and i cry tears of joy i know she smiles on her boy
i dream of you more my love goes to afeni shakur
cause like anne jones she raised a ghetto king in a war
and just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
cause one day we'll all be together sipping heavenly champagne
where angels soar with golden rings in thugz mansion",3

i have one of your skills but mom you could never be replaced
i give my life up just to see you one more day and to have

one more dance with you mama if i could only have

you resting in peace forever i accepted you free

tired of trying to run from the things inside of us
got a lot of fam and a lot of admirers
who tell me that i should aspire to be changed
but when i think of changing it's like why even try this shit
my mind hazy and my thoughts they get distorted
i know my good and bad deeds both get recorded
you do right so your soul can last
but my role was cast before i even auditioned for it
so i don't really see an end to my vice
it's just false reclamation no end of my strife
feel the evil overpowering
you can go ahead throw the towel in
cause nigga that's the end of the fight
when you can only see the tunnel at the end of the light
lights out party over it's the end of your life
and i'm out

everything's changing around me
and i wanna change too
it's one thing i know
it ain't cool being no fool
i feel different today
i don't know what else to say
but i'm-a get my shit together
it's now or never
now or never now or never now or never now or never

when i look into the mirror and see my own image
it feel like there's something else far for the distance
something i wanna see but something that's resistant
and every day the haunting is growing more persistent
i never noticed it before but now i can't miss it
and the constant pounding is driving me ballistic
i ran from it for years but it's still next to me
and it's growing stronger taking leaving less of me
i can't fight it now i know it's just destiny
and i just wonder what's gonna happen when it catches me
will it leave me face down in the chesapeake
or will it just start bringing out the best of me
but is the best of me really just the worst of me
and if so yesterday could be my anniversary
in sinners' court it's important to have church with me
i'm trying to get rid of these ghosts that's cursing me
i feel that change is an absolute certainty
'cause what's going on is a state of emergency

everything's changing around me
and i wanna change too
it's one thing i know
it ain't cool being no fool
i feel different today
i don't know what else to say
but i'm-a get my shit together
it's now or never
it's now or never",3

when i wake up i look into the mirror
i can see a clearer vision
i should start living today
cause today is gonna be the day is gonna be the day
cause today is gonna be the day is gonna be the day

blu
yeah it's like everyday i wake up i stare into space and don't say much
peer in the mirror feeling dead from the face up
coffee pots cigarettes morning js baileys
slowing down my day before it picks up the pace
beats playing since the night before thinking bout writing songs
feeling exhausted from times we toured constant
and plus the toxics i sip got me tall
still tipsy staring at the city from the spot we call los angeles
every day is like a blank canvas
carving my initials in the planet like i brand it
hand picked to live this life we take for granted
like a child with an upright bass we can't stand it
smiling through the trouble we face tryna manage
my way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant
'cause i can sit on my ass or just imagine
the madness i did on my path and paint the canvas

chorus patty cash
when i wake up i look into the mirror
i can see a clearer vision
i should start living today
cause today is gonna be the day is gonna be the day
cause today is gonna be the day is gonna be the day

black thought
before i rise and shine like a neon sign
i need the girl of my dreams to give me einstein
and burn the marijuan' like buju banton
is my only bonafide break from these confines
i need a change of scenery like a montage
these kids bringing me the noise like the bomb squad
and everybody coming at me from the blindside
i'm tired it's hard to open up my eyes wide
i listen to some theme music on the ipod
and walk around the crib doing little odd jobs
checking my breath take a view from this high rise
feeling like i'm checking out a game from the sideline
i got to try different things in these trying times
twenty-ten is different than it was in nine-five
it's come alive time i picked a fine time
for getting open off life like a fine wine

when i wake up i look into the mirror
i can see a clearer vision
i should start living today

phonte
uh yeah sunday morning plan my day out
whole new blueprint brand new layout
deep down still don't know if it'll play out
but the first time feel like i done found a way out
skin getting clearer and it feel like i lost weight
stop and say a prayer for the times i lost faith
troubles of the world had me in a cross-face
chicken-wing sickening liver so off-base
but now it's like i'm in the last lap of the car chase
and i finally understand my right to choose
my preacher man told me it could always be worse
even a three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose
so you can stop and refresh the rules
breathe in breathe out let it heal all your exit wounds
something inside said that's the move
and maybe today i'll restart fresh and new

shine bright as an example of a champion
taking the advantage never copping out or cancelling
burn like a chariot learn how to carry it

by the challenge that i find myself standing eye to eye with
then move like a wise warrior and not a coward

scared of heights so i might pass out if he flies
keep him on autopilot 'cause i can't drive
room enough for one i tell my homies they can't ride
unless they sittin' on the shoulders but that's way too high
let's try not to step on the children
the news camera's filmin' this walkin' project buildin'
now there's hoes selling hoes like right around the toes
and the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
there's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
and they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
and there's car chase going on at the waist
keep a vest on my chest
i'm sittin' in my room as i'm lookin' out the face

we need a few more half-naked women up in the pool
and hold this mac-10 that's all covered in jewels
and can you please put your titties closer to the 22's
and where's the champagne we need champagne
now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
and know hold up your chains slow motion through the flames
now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
but not too loud cause the baby's sleeping
i wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
up both sleeves while he lay there dreaming
me and my robot tip-toe round creeping
i had to turn my back on what got you paid
i couldn't see half the hood on me like abu ghraib
but i'd like to thank the streets that drove me crazy
and all the televisions out there that raised me

i just took it in stride as a part of the game but inside
people down with me started to change
it was a couple thangs little syrup little pills
instead of riding out on the road you'd rather chill
i know the way the pleasure feels i'm not judgin'
but still i'm on a mission yo i'm not buggin

they can't stick to one subject and can't eat

weighted by the gravity law you know it if you came up poor my nigga
picture the bus up north
you know we made of errething outlaws are made of
i'm far from a hata and i don't say i love you 'cause the way i feel is
greater
m-illa you a poet son you a born creator
and this'll probably dawn on you later
it's in your nature lyrics all up on you walls like they made of paper
you gotta follow where the talent take ya
ya might fuck around and finally make it and that's real but yo

i want ya all to understand i come from south philly
and when i walk the streets it's like a pharmacy
they got all type-a shit anybody can get
it go from h to x to loosie cigarettes
for my ghetto legend known for little shiest runnin'
cop codine by the quarts and keep comin' dumbin'
just embracing the dope like it's a woman
ya burning both sides of the rope and just pullin' tuggin'
in between islam and straight thuggin'
layin everyday around the way and doin' nothin'
see 'em lookin' shakin' their heads and start shruggin'
if they don't got a man like mine they gotta cousin

give birth to a style and won't give it a name

sands in the hourglass thinnin' the last inning
the flash and the cash and the fast women
it's nothing a lust for the crabs keep the passion and
blaow kissin' my tablet with firing pins
poke holes in the plastic for oxygen
mcs jumpin' out shoes and socks again
must have seen their face in the news it's gots to been
thought known as the cure for cancer
same corrupt city as mumia the panther
man to man hammer cocked block and standoff
bang gunfire slang up in the dance hall
yo i hold the mic that could be thrown as a pipe bomb
bring it just to sling it at your favorite icon

you're physically in this but how can we tell
if we was meant to be in bliss if you're not mentally as well
this energy you're sending me is tricky as hell
usually it's like a 50/50 we can take an l
before we start things
at this point being apart brings
the feeling of somebody plucking at your heart-strings
i know it probably shouldn't feel like this
but any other woman i see is in your likeness
it's from your cheekbones
to your lips
to your curves
to your deep moans
to that walk
to your words
your love feelin' like a breakdown on the verve
first we on good terms then you're on my last nerve
got my back just aching

and stand around

i used to play the corner
and watch the scene
deep down knowing i wanted to find me a queen

and up in my chest
because i knew a lot of women and some was fresh
but then i found you girl and just like me
you had a heart that was yearning to be set free
now listen
see you and me need to take the time
to erase any doubt that's inside your mind
it's not a mountain that i'm ever too tired to climb
and who's counting? - but i know at least a thousand times
i let you know i'm here for you care for you and confide in you

something in the way of things
something that will quit and won't start
something you know but can't stand
can't know get along with
like death
riding on top of the car peering through the windshield for his cue
something entirely fictitious and true
that creeps across your path hallowing your evil ways
like they were yourself passing yourself not smiling
the dead guy you saw me talking to is your boss
i tried to put a spell on him but his spirit is illiterate

i know things you know and nothing you don't know
'cept i saw something in the way of things
something grinning at me and i wanted to know was it funny?
was it so funny it followed me down the street
greeting everybody like the good humor man
but an they got the taste of good humor but no ice cream
it was like dat
me talking across people into the houses
and not seeing the beings crowding around me with ice picks
you could see them
but they looked like important negroes on the way to your funeral
looked like important jiggaboos on the way to your auction
and let them chant the number and use an ivory pointer to count your teeth
remember steppen fetchit
remember steppen fetchit how we laughed
an all your sunday school images giving flesh and giggling
with the ice pick high off his head
made ya laugh anyway

i can see something in the way of our selves
i can see something in the way of our selves
that's why i say the things i do you know it
but its something else to you
like that job
this morning when you got there and it was quiet
and the machines were yearning soft behind you
yearning for that nigga to come and give up his life
standin' there bein' dissed and broke and troubled

my mistake is i kept sayin' that was proof that god didn't exist
and you told me nah it was proof that the devil do
but still it's like i see something i hear things
i saw words in the white boy's lying rag
said he was gonna die poor and frustrated
that them dreams walk which you 'cross town
s'gonna die from over work
there's garbage on the street that's tellin' you you ain't shit
and you almost believe it
broke and mistaken all the time
you know some of the words but they ain't the right ones
your cable back on but ain't nothin' you can see
but i see something in the way of things
something to make us stumble
something get us drunk from noise and addicted to sadness
i see something and feel something stalking us
like and ugly thing floating at our back calling us names
you see it and hear it too
but you say it got a right to exist just like you and if god made it
but then we got to argue
and the light gon' come down around us
even though we remember where the light or mic is
remember the negro squinting at us through the cage
you seen what i see too?
the smile that ain't a smile but teeth flying against our necks
you see something too but can't call its name

ain't it too bad y'all said
ain't it too bad such a nice boy always kind to his motha
always say good morning to everybody on his way to work
but that last time before he got locked up and hurt real bad
i seen him walkin' toward his house and he wasn't smiling
and he didn't even say hello
but i knew he'd seen something
something in the way of things that it worked on him like it do in will
and he kept marching faster and faster away from us
and never even muttered a word
then the next day he was gone
you wanna know what
you wanna know what i'm talkin' about
sayin' i seen something in the way of things
and how the boys face looked that day just before they took him away
the is? in that face and remember now remember all them other faces
and all the many places you've seen him or the sister with his child
wandering up the street
remember what you seen in your own mirror and didn't for a second recognize
the face your own face
straining to get out from behind the glass
open your mouth like you was gon' say somethin'
close your eyes and remember what you saw and what it made you feel like
now don't you see something else
something cold and ugly
not invisible but blended with the shadow criss-crossing the old man
squatting by the drug store at the corner
with is head resting uneasily on his folded arms
and the boy that smiled and the girl he went with

and in my eyes too
a waving craziness splitting them into the jet stream of a black bird
wit his ass on fire
or the solomnotness of where we go to know we gonna be happy

i seen something
i seen something
and you seen it too
you seen it too
you just can't call it's name name name name name name name",3

a soldier comin' home twenty years old with no legs
sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain just go 'head
so much to write and say yo i don't know where to start
so i'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
i know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece
but my life been good since i started finding peace
i shouldn't even be smilin' i should be angry and depressed

staggerin' drunker than those cops that 2pac shot

reachin' soon as i heard them iron wheels screechin'
when it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
token man safe behind a locked door for sure
minor thief shit minor league shit beastin'

you could still feel chills from the team
on 118 my nigga ben fly by like it's a dream

watch the con realest channel his mom's spirit
goosebumps cover me mother's here i could feel her
blood of christ covers me our savior and healer
drug prices up or down i know a few dealers
and some accident murderers they act like they killed on purpose
liars brag they put work in
you ain't mean to murk him your gun's a virgin
better stay on point if not it's curtains
bebo posse reincarnated through me probably
if music money didn't stop me
i never claimed to be the toughest
though i'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
it's the game that we was stuck with
now i'm the only black in the club with rich yuppie kids
sad thing this is the top but where the hustlers went?
no familiar faces around ain't gotta grab the musket
it's all safe and sound champagne by the bucket
where them niggas i shouted out on my first shit?
bo cooking blow fucking slay that where turkey went?
old videos show niggas that was murdered since
another reason to get further bent

you cocked back
you thought you had it planned you thought you had your man
he saw you comin' he ran when you tried to blast that man
you missed him by inches he sprinted
some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
two of 'em pull through but one didn't son's finished
you took the life of him
the part about it that's crazy you was aiight with him
tight with him why was he in the way?
why was he standin' next to the enemy that specific day?
his style never hollas loud stays reclusive
good dude got that look like he always about to do shit
side of his mouth toothpick one eyebrow raised
got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
they never had no probs
somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
these two different personalities had to collide

took her from private school so she can get a balance
to public school they too nurture teen talents

reach out and touch the love that i have for you

i look into your eyes
i said i know you very well
i see a mirror of my life
a reflection of myself

verse 1 nas
345 am can't sleep can't dream
i'm stuck money problems pop up
how will i survive guess it's best to decide not to decide
so that's my decision
whatever happens happens
i keep makin' my millions
can see myself in presidential campaign dinners
but i'm gassin' blunts around a bunch of gang members
when you're too hood to be in them hollywood circles
and you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
and you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
and out grow women you love and thought you could stay with
life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
and leave notes around for yourself to remember
i like to teach and build
with brothers about how easy it is to reach a mill
all you need is some skill then it's grindtime
imagination better than knowledge say's einstein
it's all in the mind
nasty the nicest i'm somewhat of a psychic
just one minute after it's heard
you all excited you all repeat it
so call me a genius if you didn't
now that i said it i force you to think it
write in my little vignettes sipping moet
when you vision me you vision the best

get out of gangsta business seen in me you basic
try to compare what you live to the life i master
see the fly shit i wear you try to rock it after
big bracelets gold any different faces

bridge anthony hamilton
in danger's face
look what you're facing gave your heart away
and all the remedies couldn't ease the pain
all the hurt and betrayal need to get away
in a world so cold
you gain your life just to lose your soul
never thinking twice bout what the future holds
all the lies and the games not worth fighting for

refrain anthony hamilton
the world is an addiction
serving up a fix
the world is an addiction
it's way too much for me

verse 1 nas
snitches and rapists in the street crime to the fullest
asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
they deny me that
they know the bullets they loan me
be the same ones that probably had them lying flat stretched out
letter t
it's better to dead a beef than let it breathe
then we don't succeed
'cause then you gotta murder dummies
waste your time they allergic to money
i'm never squirmish to blood
we can thug and get out of hand
what's the options
only conclusion is shooting
bullets popping hoodlums dropping
fear any day that the feds will come knocking
was young and nervous
asking myself what's my purpose
in the back of a paddy wagon bracelets aching me
pigs ignoring i'm asking what precinct they taking me
these cops can't relate to me
death to prison empty vacancy

verse 2 nas
thou shall not be selfish real nigga commandments
know a billionaire he has everything but a fam
guess how angry this man gets
had so many bad chicks in his bed
strange sex same sex
has addictions that are sadistic
chain of events habits
he puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
self-esteem needs boosting alcohol consumption
nicotine fusion some athletes juicing
pastors quote biblical chapters psalms
all along he's into bestiality porn
and it's wrong so i keep the cali weed in the bong
and i'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
and these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high so they find dough
to mainline dope and y'all know

verse 3 nas
so many vices habits
mine of course bad chicks
my response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
i'm just rebellious not selfish
guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
i need the best things in life that's women that's cars cigars
a vintage bottle on ice that's priceless
the other night just in the emergency room
a patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
he can barely concentrate 'cause he's newly separated
his estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
in the house they were married in mad people waiting
some young some old heads and stomachs aching
filling out an application 'cause they all need medication
but the doctor need love or a quick vacation
calling up his travel agent
same time premedidating murdering his ex wife
life savage ain't it
some need xanax just to maintain it
we all need faith cause the world keep changing
let go of the illusion start some restraining

or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
i never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'
i guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'
fake it 'til you make it i've driven those toys
been in the wars in the streets cops kickin' in doors

i'm living in an elegant moroccan apartment
proletarian chicks sparking

looking at the stars and
i be in the henny woozy in the head wobbling
gucci pillow on the bed while she giving noggin
listening and tripping off the maxwell album
thinking i should leave to a european island
bristol and spain bring a book about stalin
dinner serenaded with a violin
but shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing
gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit
fine dining olive garden naw bitch nas is
in the real deal food spots on the constant
pick the right wine a chianti to wash it
lifestyle encompasses top-notch watches
rolexes synonymous shit i'm copping
ask her has she been around duffle bags full of that fuck you cash
get off the jet with me in heels
i'll cup your ass
looking in my eyes
saying nas you're one lucky bastard
grip your clutch you'll get finger fucked in the passenger
i hit the dutch blow smoke out music and laughter
see us in the coupe flying past you

esco dress code it changes
harrod's in england
back to the star spangled labels in my closet hanging
counting wonder in the tundra
can't humble the disgruntled when i come through confront ya
let nothing slide sly remarks
you must wanna die but you frontin' why?
when we all know you pumpkin pie
when we in the bus we fly better shit than emirates
to dubai to the chi
i'm a crucial conflict
heaven sent cause a storm typhoon flood you out
you are what a thug about
i'm a fuckin' juggernaut
never sleep never tire keep a freak i tie up
who don't speak she quiet
so i can think conspire
on my feet's a ? and sometimes sneakers
wear ties at the setai miami
time-pieces are from zurich
it's like i'm allergic
to nonoxynol 9
give it to you raw so you can feel it",3
16,"refrain nikki flores
just like a rose
everybody knows that you are so beautiful
but i feel a thorn on my hide
i should've known
we can't repair what we broke
but i held you close too close
i should've left your roses at the door
they're sharper than before
and i don't want them no more

i have no time to give you guidance
barely have any fuck time either
hefner minded like i think you're fine but
i seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver
mind reader can tell she vegan or not when i meet her
or if she insecure most are
if she's mixed a possible psycho alert goes off
not a judge cause a judge don't wear no draws yet he allows
everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows
my tax bracket not enough blacks have it
who should i date --
project chick or cuban actress?
a white chick they might flip talking that blackness
should only attract black shit i'm an ass magnet
if you mad at that
you'll be mad forever
never played you
i prayed we would stay together
wished it'd last forever know what i mean
heard you tear a rose from the roots the rose screams

them xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions
they some silent killers that stress shit
that put ulcers in a lot of niggas
i'm blowing medical it helps chill a violent temper
i done went to hell and back
you always think you right
you know when you wrong and still you want to fight
when people like my song
you want to kill 'em right
you resent me every time i make a million right
you want to experience life when you calling all the shots
ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot
have your own cash own your own benz
your own house everything me i understand
thought you would bask in the glory as queen bee
put you on to martin scorsese mean streets
the first movie he made thought that was fly
i thought you was flyer you a fucking liar",3

lots of thinking happens in life will i win or fail?

ethiopian food flown in it's unlawful
money is attractive honey dress strapless

stroll up in the party titanium black card
romanian ladies like casablanca casbah
'cept we in the vip area that's ours
you know the real rap gods typical trap star turned rap star
these old heads got stories the days they was kings
i pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams
you 16 you could do 20 come home young
catch 20 years when you 40? holmes you're done
what have we become? rap stars from trap stars
black gods to ansars to sunnis back to goonies
a 360 in the streets real grizzly
shooters is cold kid the old shit was learning
student enrollment to focus yet hooligans roll with
toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders
this ain't the truman show it's the human show
ask the fbi agent at his cubicle
chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
it's usa against the gangsta where's the love?

hook cocaine 80s
love i'll trade you love
i've traded fire with you long enough
is that all you brung? it's not love
that's fucked up but i saved your soul

verse 2 nas
sometimes i sit on the bench just to watch the game
feet on cement there ain't a mobster living i could name
who made it out rich in his absence i do not proclaim
to not have a heart like wild animals not tamed
maybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank
'cept i had a vision above niggas what i think
it's crazy how many brothers come where i come from
some made it out big some dead some unsung
shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up
younger generation they want to mimic and mock us
laughing separating themselves like they not us like
cops'll look at you like they look at me? that's preposterous
ain't it gangsta how your man made it? i'm humble
one gun one crazy ass nigga that's jungle
now we having babies cause growing up it was just us
no uncles or cousins to fight with us we was fucked up
but still it was beautiful the love is mutual
even though me and jung ain't show up to your funeral
i hold your son hand tell him he the man we love you
your pops was king you have a whole lot to live up to
the g is in your genes already you tuck
inherit your dad's swag his george jefferson's strut
stay flyest they gon' want to know what in your diet
don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit
tell them you let it marinate they swear you made them a promise
no matter what they do you just stay a man of honor
i'm a street corner nigga new york knicks loyalist
corona sipper pass it i'mma blow it with you
it ain't the truman show it's the human show

that's the reason the system makin' it's paper from the prison
and that's the reason we livin' where they don't wanna visit
where the dope slang and keep swayin' like sonny liston
the money missin' and it's mouths to feed
get the brain kickin' thinkin' of a thousand things
remember back in the days when the kitchen had eggs

listenin' to ultramagnetic ego trippin' you won't
pressure my word i'm the urban vision of you chump
stomped on a different ground sound second to none
synthesizers tweet to improvise your feet
i calculated every lyric to arrive on beat
it's free come get high on me
before a 9 millimeter shell hit my pelle pelle in the p
yeah it's somethin' in the water though
where i come from
they used to sing it on the corner though
where i come from
makin' somethin' out of nothin'
because everybody 50 cents from a quarter
where i come from
it's just a natural reaction for crack to make it happen
let the pen ink sink into the paper of the pad
think back hen i was younger
ghetto could have took me under
young peedi can't mess with north philly
never had you don't know about me
you ain't stroll my streets
i look familiar i feel ya
long time no see

oh
it's been a long long time
since i been back around the way
it's been a long time
let it spin let it spin let it spin
since i been back around your way
it's been a long time
long time long time

black thought
uh clap somethin' but whatever you clap
clap to the record spinnin' while i'm takin' you back
to the top paper era baby dig on that
picture the pool room where the money getters was at
and street people with the feathers in the cap of their bossolino
pullin' paper in as if it's a small casino
i was a young boy sweepin' the floors and runnin' to stores
but all those old heads would talk to me though
about the way to clutch the eagle on a buck and tuck
and if i'm down how to get back up just survival kid
and it's the struggle worldwide i'm positive
shit the ghetto might as well be the gaza strip
you know where all of the monsters is
you don't see no consciousness
street walkers
i'm comin' back to where the core of the problem is
we on the job again y'all know what time it is

oh
it's been a long long time
since i been back around the way
it's been a long time
let it spin let it spin let it spin
since i been back around your way
it's been a long time

it ain't nowhere to run it ain't hardly nowhere to hide
they hear you when you whisperin' so try to keep quiet
you don't even realize that you's a twinkle in the all seein' eye
from the time you in the bar gettin' high
to havin' conversations on your phone through the wire
you can drive but it's definitely footage of your ride
livin' in this day and time it's a funny kind of vibe
from the corners of the ceilin' feel it's eyes in back of me
i couldn't tell you why i think they constantly after me
maybe it's 'cause the news put it to me so graphically
how niggas don't obey no laws not even gravity boy

yo my man jd was a true hip-hop artist
 i can't explain the influence that his mind and ear have had on my band myself and the careers of so many other artists
the most humble modest worthy and gifted beatmaker i've known
and definitely the best producer on the mic
never without that signature smile and head bouncin' to the beat
jd had a passion for life and music and will never be forgotten
he's a brother that was loved by me &amp i love what he's done for us

red man was the first on the continent
this you gotta understand
woman not behind she's right beside him there
and they both toil land
white man fightin for independence from an old empire
woman makes a flag for a new nation and
let's the flag waves high
black woman is stripped of her kingdom and
bought the breastfeeding new
black man mentally he broke it too
but the cream always rise to the top
that's what men and women do
man/woman always doin' the dance
one wops one pops
we'd be lucky if we both find a groove
that we both can lock
can man be stronger if a woman was there?
i would have to say yes
can woman make it without men being there?
she would have to be blessed
woman and man are the spiritual forces
brought together to live
good thing there's many of us here in the world today

second shift 'til the neck is stiff

soon after that baby's daddy/lazy bum with no cash
he wanna come over and crash
he wanna play his part

explain better when you're tryin' to see some better days

butterflies now who's got chase?

same daddy same broke ass situation
this time the doc said her heart might break
praise god that the job got her health benefits straight
she believes in the right to choice
but she loves baby girl and she wants a boy
makes more nowadays on the day shift
balance that with night classes
take some time and space and make it all fit
the apartment they now live in is overcrowded
raised her voice and made her point
told that boy go get employed
he put on his best shirt
said he wasn't comin' back 'til he gets work
she knew what that part meant
so she swept every piece out that apartment

rather only hafta feed three mouths

gonna make that home a home
with or without a man that she can call her own

continues to hand her the wrong advances
she passes the test she knew the answers
quit the job to go take a chance with life
this is life we all strain
while we pray for dollars and we work for change
it's all the same we all struggle
sometimes you gotta say fuck you
when you smile and she doesn't return it
give her room and don't disturb it
if it makes it hurt less to curse and fight
go ahead and hate the world girl you earned the right now

i've hit a couple of snags that remind me of the past
i can't front i'm having a blast
but damned if i ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last

sittin' here wishin' we could kick it
givin' me your opinions i do miss the criticisms
i didn't mean to be distant make a visit
i wait up and keep the coffee brewin' in the kitchen

but who am i jokin' with?
there's no way that you and i will ever get to re-open it
it doesn't matter this is more than love
and maybe if i'm lucky get to see you out the corner of

yesterday was that you? looked just like you
strange things my imagination might do
take a breath reflect on what we've been through
or am i just goin' crazy 'cause i miss you?

yesterday was that you? looked just like you
strange things my imagination might do
take a breath reflect on what we've been through
or am i just goin' crazy 'cause i miss you?

and when you left i didn't see it coming
i guess i slept it ain't like you was runnin'
you crept out the front door slow
and i was so self absorbed i didn't even know

and by the time i looked up it was booked up
put it all behind you the bad and the good stuff
a whole house full of dreams and steps
i think you'd be impressed with the pieces i kept

you disappeared but the history is still here
that's why i try not to cry over spilled beer
i can't even get mad that you gone
leavin' me was probably the best thing you ever taught me

i'm sorry
it's official
i was a fist-full
i didn't keep it simple
chip on the shoulder anger in my veins
has so much hatred now it brings me shame

never thought about the world without you
and i promise that i'll never say another bad word about you
i thought i saw you yesterday
but i know it wasn't you because you passed away dad

looked just like you
strange things my imagination might do
take a breath reflect on what we've been through
or am i just goin' crazy 'cause i miss you?",3
9,"these warehouse wages kill the ends introduction
man i shoulda' schooled it up when i was younger should of stuck to plan
always had the dreams of bein' more self-assertive
and my kid's a teenager now he needs the health insurance
so break my body break-break my soul down
just another zombie walkin' blindly through ya ghost town
pull up to the bar to politic and tap the power
ain't nobody really all that jolly at your happy hour
but i don't wanna go home yet
so i'ma talk to my cigarette and that television set
it doesn't matter what brand or station
anything to take away from the current situation
no overtime pay no holiday
months behind on everything but the lottery
winter 'round the corner guaranteein' that my car dies
wifey havin' trouble tryna juggle both the part-times
my cup ain't close to filled up
we tryna build up so we could have enough
and when i finally get the color won't be nothin' left to paint on
a friend of mine tried to kill himself to the same song

my better half is mad at makin' magic outta can goods
my tax bracket status got her questionin' my manhood
my shorty got caught smokin' weed at a concert
and if i smack him everybody treats me like a monster
my neighbors ain't doin' much better
and we make it competition instead of stickin' together
can't save no nest egg in fact this nest is rented
in fact that rent is late wait
the money ain't here the raise ain't comin'
just me and my son and that crazy woman
and those bartenders this whole fuckin' country
got everybody swallowin' that lunch meat
maybe we could speed up the process
kill me in my thirties in the name of progress
put me in the dirt and then change the topic
sometimes seems like the only way to stop it
contemplate my departure date
doesn't take a lot to get a lot of us to talk this way
take a shot at me that's all i'm obligated for
apparently my only guarantee is a walk-away

the only guarantee in life
is a life worth dying for
'cause death don't wait for no one
he's sitting on your front door

10,"yeah the child in the mirror was homely
so he learned early on how to switch into low key
little person observant and accurate
glue the skills to argue and the passion the back it with

kick over the blocks just to rebuild 'em
cause mom and pop used to pop me sound familiar?
daddy had to leave but momma kept hurtin'
so he stepped up to help to be an anger and a burden

and right around the same time
started noticing girls but they wouldn't pay him any mind
and if they ever did he got nervous
you shoulda seen him practice on his hand for his first kiss

even though he was too young to hunt and gather
hungry puppy had to learn how to front and swagger
it didn't matter it was all self esteem
at 16 you only needed one on your team

mom and dad was never gettin' back together
so he was on some 'baby we gon' make it last forever'
basically married right out of high school
five years of gettin' high and fightin at a drive through

and when he hit 21 they made a son
but on his 22nd birthday the relationship was done
now hes got a best friend instead of a wife
but he feels like he stole the best years of her life

after that it was one co dependent to the next
a lot of love a lot of hate and a little bit of great sex
self learnin in between the self loathing
strangled in a cycle can't feel yourself choking

some of them would overlapse
some of them would double back
none of them deserved to be exposed
to all the troubled that he posed

strike one not even out of fear
he don't even do rough sex you bite him and hes outa here
make no mistake he puts the man in manipulate
and hes attracted to the women that reciprocate

y'all can kick karma till its gettin' late
until mammas little drama is the topic of the big debate
and nowadays the confidence is off the page
'cause women are attracted to that clown on the stage

he's only in town for a hand full of hours
but rupunzel wants to come down and dance in the flowers
wanna make her smile? want to make her laugh?
want to make up for the mistakes in the past?

want to act like he doesn't know better
if payback's a bitch he'll be in debt forever
insecure impatient
temporary radification self validation

that's what its made of it's all true
and it's the only reason he's even talkin' to you

you can try and fix my broken wings
you can know all the words to the songs i sing
but you don't need to know what's wrong with me
unless you think you're gonna come home with me

you can try and fix my broken wings
you can know all the words to the songs i sing
but you don't need to know what's wrong with me
unless you think you're gonna come home with me

come here

11,"he knew he wasn't perfect
but he always did his best to try to get under the surface
not a saint not a serpent
he just wanted everyone to be impressed with him as a person

so when she came along with the sunbeam
self-esteem stopped making nothing outta somethings
leaving the scene was unseen i mean
it was the first time he ever felt the need to keep the gun clean

do the math
he knew he had to choose a path
gotta get that girl gotta make her laugh
gotta shake the past and move forwards
gotta make this last it feels gorgeous

but she had a lover in the mid-west
never figured out how to get him off her thick chest
just like that everything is gone
he didn't wanna but he had to learn the words so he could sing along

everything is all i have to give you
and i'm afraid it ain't enough
and you're not so young that you believe me
just because i say its love

and even if they come to steal you tomorrow
i'll know my smile was yours
go ahead and chase your dreams and your freedom
run run wild wild horses

you can't tame these horses
you can't tame these horses no
you can't tame these horses
you can't tame these horses

sometimes it can be so nice right?
sometimes she feel herself turn into the wife type
and when its dark sometimes he's the nightlight
but most of the time she doesn't even feel lifelike

she got a man but he thinks hes a star
and it feels like she has to compete with the bar
she keeps up her guard but it seems so hard
mama never told her she would see those scars

every night he's out doing who knows whom
while she cries along like a new show tune
last call passed is he coming home soon?
or is he gonna run away with the dish and the spoon?

she'll realize she don't want that clown
leave those shoes at the lost and found
he won't catch on until she's not around
after somebody else already locked that down
we sing

everything is all i have to give you
and i'm afraid it ain't enough
and you're not so young that you believe me
just because i say its love

and even if they come to steal you tomorrow
i'll know my smile was yours
go ahead and chase your dreams and your freedom
run run wild wild horses

you can't tame these horses
you can't tame these horses no
you can't tame these horses
you can't tame these horses

he didn't want her to see him leave
and he couldn't keep sitting there watching her sleep
'cause he knows if he hangs out for a few hours
he'll dig another hole trying to plant some new flowers

but the sun don't shine under the table
he's trying to hold his life together with staples
no investment 'cause he's incapable
and he's on the outro of being labeled available

the word on the street is his girl's comin' back home
no more alone no more sad poems
no after-bar calls to the cell phone
its time to walk a new path and grow a backbone

shoved into the big book of just friends
wondering how he would look as a husband
and everyone of 'em he ever allowed to love him
now watching from the crowd tryin' to be proud of him
they say

everything is all i have to give you
and i'm afraid it ain't enough
and you're not so young that you believe me
just because i say its love

and even if they come to steal you tomorrow
i'll know my smile was yours
go ahead and chase your dreams and your freedom

you can't tame these horses no
you can't tame these horses

12,"he wanted to make a difference be understood right?
wanted to go the distance wanted to live that good life
put some work on that wood jumped and took flight
left his hand writin' in that book what that look like?
happy mess is the reach touch and manifest it
caught between respect your momma
and them battle weapons
lost your adolescence at them intersections
spread them wings
and you're gonna need some landin' lessons
the sun is gonna burn them feathers
lost track of time tryin' to ride the bender
used to have an agenda but really why remember?
doesn't matter when your head's in
a bottle somewhere in tribeca
or maybe you sedate it up in silverlake
cheatin' fate first rate feelin' great
tryin' to turn a first date
into a friendly game of kill the snake
can't wait to get her face against a pillow case

progress that came with a cost
rejoice for the rain that will wash
multiple choice you can stay on that cross
or grab it by the arms and break 'em off

the wheels are stopped done so let me off
deal the cards but already lost
kill me now just to get applause
steal the shot run and set it off
i feel and i fear and i want and i can't break away

if they buy it for you how you not gonna drink it?
if they fry it for you how you not gonna eat it?
if they throw it to you how you not gonna hold it?
touch it taste it love it and fuck with it a moment?
every city's the same scene gangrene
vampire's lookin' at your veins fangs craving
interchangeable hair similar name jeans
faux-made take charge and late start playthings
it ain't harder to tell
they rebel to celebrate the day their martyr had fell
now meet him at the bar 'cause it's part of the sell
felt at peace leavin' pieces of his heart at hotels
stepped in with his next new best friend
on the bed's edge loadin' up on the weapon
tryin' to win big all bets in
now pull the bedspread back and pop that essence

deal the cards but already lost

13,"a city full of people and my favorite is that waitress
and she treats me like some kind of common vagrant
i see her every day but there's nothing to say
unless i decide to step inside of that cafe

i only get to sit if i buy something to eat
otherwise its best to keep my feet moving down that street
and goddamn she's a hard bitch
she talks at like i'm the bad dog that got into the garbage

yeah i know that the toilet is for customers
you ain't gotta tangle up the strings that make this puppet work
it doesn't have to be a game of paddy-cake
but it ain't like you don't know i sleep in that alleyway

and by the way i can see it in your eyes
you're angry with your life not a stranger to the fight
i bet you hate every man that you date
and you're probably addicted to all types of escape

you take it out on me that you're all alone
when you know you got your own closet full of hollow bones
watch the tone when you speak to old folks
i'm grown just trying to get out of this minnesota cold

look lady i'm homeless i'm crazy
i'm so hopeless i'm suicidal daily
if you and i can't coexist let's fake it
'cause i ain't got the energy it takes for this relationship

i'm waiting for a city bus to flatten me
and transport me to the ever after happily
maybe reincarnate and with luck
come back to earth as a cockroach in your tip cup huh

she says she's had it up to here
she's gonna call authorities if i don't disappear
i love her threats it rejuvinates my breath
i give her stress for the reaction that it gets

i got a pocket full of panhandled money
on a cup of bad coffee and a stale honey bun
in front of everyone she calls me bum
but she notices my absence on those afternoons i don't come

so here i am thorn in her hip
corner table all morning with some corn chips
ignoring the insults and evil eyes
i feed off 'em i wonder when she'll realize

she's the only reason i visit
the only woman in my world that acknowledges my existence
and if my ship ever comes i'll miss it
because i'm getting old and i ain't got much left to give it

so there it is and i have to live with it
i had the chance to make a difference but i didn't
in a cafe bathroom drinking free tap water
thinking damn i should have been a better father to my daughter",3
14,"she had a bad dream in the back seat
the same one as yesterday the same one as last week
surrounded by her favorite favorites
elmo barbie her purple baby blanket

and that little matchbox looks just like dad's car
its fast on the leather pretends its nascar
it jumps over elmo cause it can fly that far
with daddy in the front seat frontin' like a rap star

and girl oh girl daddy's the greatest
he knows the words to everything on the radio play list
he fakes the accent even makes all the faces
and when he raises his voice it makes her feel like he's famous

yeah papa got his lean on a mean one
weavin down lake street tryin' to get his scene on
stoppin' the whip to say something out the window
bobbin his head to the beat on the radio

good daddy wont smoke no weed
until the bass cradles her back to sleep
but he can steak his mac while she takes a nap
to the sweet pretty sounds of the gangsta rap

the high hats are angles' voices
they keep her distracted from the strangers' voices
escape is a paradox
because the childhood is locked in that music box

daddys drive around mommys work night shifts
sweet dreams sleep little precious
lay down in that music box
escape in the sound of

daddys drive around mommys work night shift

yeah daddy knows people he's important
the guy with the suit and tie they see at the court
and it seems like he ain't tryin' to talk to police
but at the car wash they treat him like the star that she sees

they like poppa's big wheels
and the lollipop she gets makes her feel like a big deal
not allowed to have it yet gotta sit still
like the toy that she knows is gonna come with the kids meal

she loves drive-through food
health conscious dad he buys her the juice
a little sip of soda builds the pride
go ahead baby-girl don't spill those fries

nu-uh papa can't roll a messy office
compulsive in the way she lay them napkins all across the seat
never puts her feet up on the upholstery
just kicks 'em side to side to the beat on the radio

she sings along like dad does
she knows all the words but she leaves out the bad ones
except bitch she always sings the word bitch
cause it makes her daddy laugh it's her magic trick

and when daddy picks mommy up they fight
they fight about money they fight about life
so she concentrates oh so hard on the music
and loses herself inside of the bass and the movement

daddys drive around mommys work night shift
sweet dreams sleep little precious

she ain't the avon lady but her beauty was strong
right before she went to rest she had me singin' this song
she must be a special lady
and a very exciting girlllllllllll
i don't know
she had the high-glow's switchin
see her in the club you hear others chicks bitchin
but dawn quit to bust a bitch ass and shit
see she did 12 months over a ratchet
not no crab shit
got bagged with the mag
taxi cab shit
clit was hangin' out her panties with no where to stash it
it was classic
nowadays she's laid back
helpin me perfect my rap
only pink and smoked salmon where she feed her cat
wife everything
diamond cut like johnny lex collar attached
lickin' glass bowls in her cat clothes
cause crazy stacks
finicky thing
her kittin drink pollar spring
take naps
near her jewerly box
she play with all the rings
and when she step out the tub it's like an ill flick
carmel skin bath and body works leave the whole room lit

i'm watching pornos to see just how to stroke right

i'm in her crib now a nigga palm sweatin

i got four brothers one mother that don't love us
if they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?
i felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
and thought about how far we done came
from trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
thank you mama dry your eyes there ain't no reason to cry
you made a genius and i ain't gon' take it for granted

will i return or will i burn never know
look in my eyes and see the future
but don't sugar coat it

listen
history repeats itself and that's just how it goes
same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
same thing that my nigga elvis did with rock 'n' roll
justin timberlake eminem and then macklemore
while silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound
this year i'll prolly go to the awards dappered down
watch iggy win a grammy as i try to crack a smile
i'm just playin' but all good jokes contain true shit
same rope you climb up on they'll hang you with
but not jermaine my aim too sick
i bang nigga i came to bring the pain my brain too quick
you see how i maneuver this game i ain't stupid
i recognize that life is a dream and i dream lucid
and break the chains and change minds one verse at a time
and claim 2-6 and fuck it if the shoe fits
who's the king?

we all kings
we all kings nigga
kings of ourselves first and foremost
true
while the people debate who's the king of this rap game
here comes lil' ol' jermaine
with every ounce of strength in his veins
to snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
but rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
poof boom paow it's like magic
with a flash and a bang the crown disintegrates
and falls to the earth from which it came
it's done
ain't gonna be no more kings
be wary of any man that claims
because deep down he clings onto the need for power
but in reality he's a coward
ultimately he's scared to die
and sometimes so am i
but when i'm in tune with the most high
i realize
the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
today i know that we are the same
are the same you and i
different kind of skin different set of eyes
two different minds but only one god
it's only one god nigga
it's for all the kings
'cause i know deep down every poet just wanna be loved",3

she don't wanna be saved

no role models and i'm here right now
no role models to speak of
searchin' through my memory my memory i couldn't find one
last night i was gettin' my feet rubbed
by the baddest bitch not trina but i swear to god
this bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her hey what's good?
sorry i'm never comin' home i'ma stay for good
then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
i came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
ain't got no shame 'bout it
she think i'm spoiled and i'm rich 'cause i can have any bitch
i got defensive and said nah i was the same without it
but then i thought back back to a better me
before i was a b-list celebrity
before i started callin' bitches bitches so heavily
back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
you wasn't sweatin' me

one time for my la sisters
one time for my la hoes
lame niggas can't tell the difference
one time for a nigga who know
don't save her
she don't wanna be saved
don't save her
she don't wanna be saved
don't save her
she don't wanna be saved
don't save her
she don't wanna be saved

i want a real love dark skinned and aunt viv love
that jada and that will love
that leave a toothbrush at your crib love
and you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
nigga i don't want no bitch from reality shows
out of touch with reality hoes
out in hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
fuck em' then we kick em' to the door
nigga you know how it go
she deserved that she a bird it's a bird trap
you think if i didn't rap she would flirt back
takin' off her skirt let her wear my shirt before she leave
i'ma need my shirt back nigga you know how it go

one time for my la sisters
one time for my la hoes
lame niggas can't tell the difference
one time for a nigga who know
don't save her
she don't wanna be saved
don't save her
she don't wanna be saved
don't save her
she don't wanna be saved
don't save her
she don't wanna be saved

there's an old saying in tennessee - i know it's in texas - probably in tennessee that says fool me once shame on - shame on you if you fool me we can't get fooled again

fool me one time shame on you
fool me twice can't put the blame on you
fool me three times fuck the peace signs
load the chopper let it rain on you

fool me one time shame on you
fool me twice can't put the blame on you
fool me three times fuck the peace signs
load the chopper let it rain on you

my only regret was too young for lisa bonet
my only regret was too young for nia long
now all i'm left with is hoes from reality shows
hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
my only regret was too young for sade adu
my only regret could never take aaliyah home
now all i'm left with is hoes up in greystone
with the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
she shallow but the pussy deep she shallow she shallow
she shallow but the pussy deep she shallow she shallow
she shallow but the pussy deep she shallow she shallow

until they snatched it from my mama
and foreclosed her on the loan
i'm so sorry that i left you there to deal with that alone
i was up in new york city chasing panties getting dome
had no clue what you was going through how could you be so strong?
and how could i be so selfish i know i can be so selfish
i could tell by how i treat you with my girl
damn she so selfless but she put up with my way
because she loves me like you do
and though it don't always show i love her just like i love you
and i need to treat you better
wish you could live forever so we could spend more time together

living with nothin' to lose

of the brother to blame is quite plain
it's not the reign but a brother who don't claim
or aim to be a preacher or ordain
i have black thoughts therefore my names the same
no question my ability
in the studio facility
as i exercise my god given utility
on time i get behind and push along a rhyme of mine which i design with what? the mind
leave mc's blind with amnesia
chop 'em in a salad and my name ain't caeser
think twice before you approach
get benched by the coach
like eggs your poached
i wrote murdah so you could say it's murder he wrote
you think i'm hell sent so you repent to the pope
so don't walk when the sign says not to
and don't talk when black thoughts about to
when i say maestro and bro starts to play it
if you got a rhyme in your mind then don't say it
save it for the weaker
pack your portable speaker
and utilize the treads on your sneaker
and take your sorry crew back in forget about rappin'
forget you ever saw me and forget this ever happened
'cause you might have nightmares of mc's being slain
and i'll be to blame when you go insane",3
