too black too strong

yo chuck these alley trippers are still frontin' on us

bass how low can you go
death row what a brother know
once again back is the incredible rhyme animal
the uncannable d public enemy number one
five-o said “freeze” and i got numb
can i tell 'em that i never really had a gun
but it's the wax that the terminator x spun
now they got me in a cell cause my records they sell
cause a brother like me said well
farrakhan's a prophet and i think you ought to listen to
what he can say to you
what you ought to do is follow for now
power of the people say
make a miracle d pump the lyrical
black is back all in we're gonna win
check it out yeah y'all come on
here we go again

turn it up
bring the noise
turn it up

hey yo chuck they say we too black man bring the noise
yo i don’t understand what they’re sayin'
but little do they know they can get a smack for that man

never badder than bad cause the brother is madder than mad
at the fact that's corrupt like a senator
soul on a roll but you treat it like soap on a rope
cause the beats and the lines are so dope
listen for lessons i'm saying inside music
that the critics are blasting me for
they'll never care for the brothers and sisters
now across the country has us up for the war
we got to demonstrate come on now
they're gonna have to wait till we get it right
radio stations i question their blackness
they call themselves black but we'll see if they'll play this

turn it up
bring the noise
turn it up

hey yo chuck they’re illin' we chillin' bring the noise
yo pe in the house top billin'
yo chuck show 'em what you can do boy

get from in front of me the crowd runs to me
my deejay is warm he's x i call him norm y'know
he can cut a record from side to side
so what the ride the glide much should be safer than a suicide
soul control beat is the father of your rock'n'roll
music for whatcha for whichin' you call a band man
making a music abuse it but you can't do it y'know
you call 'em demos but we ride limos too
whatcha gonna do rap is not afraid of you
beat is for sonny bono beat is for yoko ono
run-dmc first said a deejay could be a band
stand on its feet get you out your seat
beat is for eric b and ll as well hell wax is for anthrax
still it can rock bells
ever forever universal it will sell
time for me to exit terminator x it

turn it up

turn it up

yo they should know by now that they can’t stop this bum rush bring the noise
word up better keep tellin' me to turn it down
but yo flavor flav ain't going out like that

come on

from coast to coast so you stop being like a comatose
stand my man the beat's the same with a boast toast
rock with some pizzazz it will last why you ask
roll with the rock stars still never get accepted as
we got to plead the fifth you can investigate
no need to wait get the record straight hey

what's wrong with all these people around here man
is there clockin'

now here's what i want y'all to do for me

chuck d and flavor flav
back
caught you looking for the same thing
it's a new thing check out this i bring
uh oh the roll below the level 'cause i'm living low
next to the bass c'mon turn up the radio
they claiming i'm a criminal
but now i wonder how some people never know
the enemy could be their friend guardian
i'm not a hooligan i rock the party and
clear all the madness i'm not a racist
preach to teach to all 'cause some they never had this
number one not born to run about the gun
i wasn't licensed to have one
the minute they see me fear me
i'm the epitome a public enemy
used abused without clues
i refuse to blow a fuse
they even had it on the news

flavor flav

chuck d and flavor flav
yes was the start of my last jam
so here it is again another def jam
but since i gave you all a little something that i knew you lacked
they still consider me a new jack
all the critics you can hang 'em i'll hold the rope
but they hope to the pope and pray it ain't dope
the follower of farrakhan
don't tell me that you understand until you hear the man
the book of the new school rap game
writers treat me like coltrane insane
yes to them but to me i'm a different kind
we're brothers of the same mind unblind
caught in the middle and not surrendering
i don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
some claim that i'm a smuggler
some say i never heard of ya a rap burglar
false media we don't need it do we?
it's fake that's what it be to ya dig me?
yo terminator x step up on the stand
and show these people what time it is boy

chuck d flavor flav and harry allen
don't believe the hype it's a sequel
as an equal can i get this through to you
my 98 booming with a trunk of funk
all the jealous punks can't stop the dunk
coming from the school of hard knocks
some perpetrate they drink clorox
attack the black because i know they lack exact
the cold facts and still they try to xerox
the leader of the new school uncool
never played the fool just made the rules
remember there's a need to get alarmed
again i said i was a time bomb
in the daytime radio's scared of me
'cause i'm mad plus i'm the enemy
they can't come on and play me in prime time
'cause i know the time 'cause i'm getting mine
i get on the mix late in the night
they know i'm living right so here go the mike sike
before i let it go don't rush my show
you try to reach and grab and get elbowed
word to herb yo if you can't swing this
learn the words you might sing this
just a little bit of the taste of the bass for you
as you get up and dance at the lq
when some deny it defy it i swing bolos
and then they clear the lane i go solo
the meaning of all of that some media is the wack
as you believe it's true
it blows me through the roof
suckers liars get me a shovel
some writers i know are damn devils
for them i say don't believe the hype
yo chuck they must be on the pipe right?
their pens and pads i'll snatch 'cause i've had it
i'm not a addict fiending for static
i'll see their tape recorder and i grab it
no you can't have it back silly rabbit
i'm going to my media assassin
harry allen i gotta ask him
yo harry you're a writer are we that type?
don't believe the hype

truth that we pumping into them clogged up brain cells

sheet he's bad by his damn self
yeah his one job cold threatens the crowd
the loud sound pound to make brothers proud

gettin' small makin' room for it all
flavors on the phone so he can

11,"i got a letter from the government
the other day
i opened and read it
it said they were suckers
they wanted me for their army or whatever
picture me given' a damn - i said never
here is a land that never gave a damn
about a brother like me and myself
because they never did
i wasn't wit' it but just that very minute
it occurred to me
the suckers had authority
cold sweatin' as i dwell in my cell
how long has it been?
they got me sittin' in the state pen
i gotta get out - but that thought was thought before
i contemplated a plan on the cell floor
i'm not a fugitive on the run
but a brother like me begun - to be another one
public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all
to criticize me some crime - never the less
they could not understand that i'm a black man
and i could never be a veteran
on the strength the situation's unreal
i got a raw deal so i'm goin' for the steel

they got me rottin' in the time that i'm servin'
tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'
4 of us packed in a cell like slaves - oh well
the same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell
you have to realize - what it's a form of slavery
organized under a swarm of devils
straight up - word'em up on the level
the reasons are several most of them federal
here is my plan anyway and i say
i got gusto but only some i can trust - yo
some do a bid from 1 to 10
and i never did and plus i never been
i'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
cell block and locked - i never clock it y'all
'cause time and time again time
they got me servin' to those and to them
i'm not a citizen
but ever when i catch a c-o
sleepin' on the job - my plan is on go-ahead
on the strength i'ma tell you the deal
i got nothin' to lose
'cause i'm goin' for the steel

you know i caught a c-o
fallin' asleep on death row
i grabbed his gun - then he did what i said so
and everyman's got served
along with the time they served
decency was deserved
to understand my demands
i gave a warnin' - i wanted the governor y'all
and plus the warden to know
that i was innocent -
because i'm militant
posing a threat you bet it's fuckin' up the government
my plan said i had to get out and break north
just like with oliver's neck
i had to get off - my boys had the feds in check
they couldn't do nothin'
we had a force to instigate a prison riot
this is what it takes for peace
so i just took the piece
black for black inside time to cut the leash
freedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out
6 c-os we got we ought to put their head out
but i'll give 'em a chance 'cause i'm civilized
as for the rest of the world they can't realize
a cell is hell - i'm a rebel so i rebel
between bars got me thinkin' like an animal
got a woman c-o to call me a copter
she tried to get away and i popped her
twice right
now who wanna get nice?
i had 6 c-os now it's 5 to go
and i'm serious - call me delirious
but i'm still a captive
i gotta rap this
time to break as time grows intense
i got the steel in my right hand
now i'm lookin' for the fence

i ventured into the courtyard
followed by 52 brothers
bruised battered and scarred but hard
goin' out with a bang
ready to bang out
but power from the sky
and from the tower shots rang out
a high number of dose - yes
and some came close
figure i trigger my steel
stand and hold my post
this is what i mean - an anti-nigger machine
if i come out alive and then they won't - come clean
and then i threw up my steel bullets - flew up
blew up who shot
what who the bazooka was who
and to my rescue it was the s1ws
secured my getaway so i just gotaway
the joint broke from the black smoke
then they saw it was rougher thatn the average bluffer
'cause the steel was black the attitude exact
now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon

'cause i want it

it's like that i'm like nat
leave me the hell alone
if you don't think i'm a brother
then check the chromosomes
then check the stage
i declare it a new age
get down for the prophets of rage
keep you from gettin' like this

you back the track
you find we're the quotable
you emulate
brothers sisters that's beautiful
follow a path
of positivity you go
some sing it or rap it
or harmonize it through go-go
little you know but very
seldom i do party jams
about a plan

i'm considered the man
i'm the recordable
but god made it affordable
i say it you play it
back in your car or even portable
stereo
describes my scenario
left or right black or white
they tell lies in the books
that you're readin'
it's knowledge of yourself
that you're needin'
like vescey or prosser
we have a reason why
to debate the hate
that's why we're born to die

pumpin' what you're used to
until the whole juice crew

and we're out to get it
i know some of you ain't wid it
this party started right in 66
with a pro-black radical mix
then at the hour of twelve
some force cut the power
and emerged from hell
it was your so called government
that made this occur
like the grafted devils they were

j edgar hoover and he coulda proved to you
he had king and x set up
also the party with newton cleaver and seale
he ended so get up
time to get 'em back
you got it
get back on the track
you got it
word from the honorable elijah muhammed
know who you are to be black

to those that disagree it causes static
for the original black asiatic man
cream of the earth
and was here first
and some devils prevent this from being known
but you check out the books they own
even masons they know it
but refuse to show it yo
but it's proven and fact
and it takes a nation of millions to hold us back",1
0,"i ain't no joke i use to let the mic smoke
now i slam it when i'm done and make sure it's broke
when i'm gone no one gets on 'cause i won't let
nobody press up and mess up the seen i set
i like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder damn
but think about it then you'll understand
i'm just an addict addicted to music
maybe it's a habit i gotta use it
even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
i hook a beat up convert it into hip-hop form
write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in
deep concentration 'cause i'm no comedian
jokers are wild if you wanna be tamed
i treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
another enemy not even a friend of me
'cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be
competin' 'cause i just put your mind on pause
and i complete when - you compare my rhyme wit yours
i wake you up and as i stare in your face you seem stunned
remember me the one you got your idea from
but soon you start to suffer the tune'll get rougher
when you start to stutter that's when you had enuff of
biting it'll make you choke you can't provoke
you can't cope you should've broke because i ain't no joke

i got a question as serious as cancer
who can keep the average dancer
hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling
'cause you're expressing the rhyme that i'm styling
this is what we all sit down to write
you can't make it so you take it home break it and bite
use pieces and bits of all the hip-hop hits
get the style down pat then it's time to switch
put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
then you fake it you're ready for the neighborhood chores
the e-m-c-e-e don't even try to be
when you come up to speak don't even lie to me
you like to exaggerate dream and imaginate
then change the rhyme around that can aggravate me
so when you see me come up freeze
or you'll be one of those 7 mc's
they think that i'm a new jack but only if they knew that
they who think wrong are they who can't do that
style that i'm doing they might ruin
patterns and paragraphs based on you and
your offbeat dj if anything he play
sound familiar i'll wait till e say
play 'em so i'ma have to diss and bro
you could get a smack for this i ain't no joke

i hold the microphone like a grudge
b'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
i hold a conversation 'cause when i invent
i nominated my dj to president
when i'm see i'll keep a freestyle going steadily
so pucker up and whistle my melody
but whatever you do don't miss one
they'll be another rough rhyme after this one
before you know it you're following and fiending
waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
like before the middle of my story i'm telling
nobody beats the r so stop yelling
save it put it in your pocket for later
'cause i'm moving the crowd and b'll wreck the fader
no interruptions till the mic is broke
when i'm gone then you can joke
'cause everything is real on a serious tip
keep playing and i varies quick
and take you for a walk through hell
freeze your dome then watch your eyeballs swell
guide you out of triple stage darkness
when it get dark again then i'ma spark this
microphone 'cause the heat is on you see smoke
then i finish when the beat is gone i'm no joke",1
2,"turn up the bass check out my melody hand out a cigar
i'm lettin knowledge be born and my name's the r
a-k-i-m not like the rest of them i'm not on a list
that's what i'm sayin' i drop science like a scientist
my melody's in a code the very next episode
has the mic often distortin' ready to explode
i keep the mic at fahrenheit freeze mc's to make 'em colder
the listener's system is kickin' like solar
as i memorize advertise like a poet
keep you goin' when i'm flowin' smooth enough you know it
but rough that's why the moral of my story i tell eb
nobody beats the r check out my melody

so what i'm a microphone fiend addicted soon as i seen
one of these four mc's so they don't have to scream
i couldn't wait to take the mic flow into it to test it
let 'my melody' play then a record suggest it
i'm droppin' bombs but i stay peace and calm
any mc that disagree with me wave your arm
and i'll break when i'm through breakin' i'll leave you broke
drop the mic when i'm finished and watch it smoke
so stand back you wanna rap? all of that can wait
i won't push i won't beat around the bush
i wanna break upon those who are not supposed to
you might try but you can't get close to
because i'm number one competition is none
i'm measured with the heat that's made by sun
'cause i'm playin' ball or bobbin' in the hall
or just writin my name in graffiti on the wall
you shouldn't have told me you said you controlled me
so now a contest is what you owe me
pull out your money pull out your cut
pull up a chair and i'm a tear shit up
my name is rakim allah and r and a stands for ra
switch it around it still comes out r
so easily will i e-m-c-e-e
my repetition of words is check out my melody
some bass and treble is moist scratch in and cut in a voice
and when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice
i wouldn't a came and said my name and run same weak shit
puttin' blurbs and slurs and words that don't fit
in a rhyme why waste time on the microphone
i take this more serious than just a poem
rockin' party to party backyard to yard
i tear it up y'all and bless the mic for the gods

the rhyme is rugged at the same time sharp
i can swing off anything even a string of a harp
just turn it on and start rockin' mine no introduction
till i finish droppin' science no interruption
when i approach i exercise like a coach
usin' a melody and add new verse ? and notes
so when the mic and the r-a-k-i-m
it's attached like a match i will strike again
rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped
put in a order to pursue with the momentum except
i say one rhyme out of order a longer rhyme shorter
a pause but don't stop the tape recorder

i'm not a regular competitor first rhyme editor
melody arranger poet etcetera
extra event the grand finale-like bonus
i am the man they call the microphonist
with wisdom which means wise words bein' spoken
too many at one time watch the mic start smokin'
i came to express the rap i manifest
stand in my way and i'll veto on the word's protest
mc's that wanna be vissed ? they're gonna
be dissed if they don't get from in fronta
all they can go get is me a glass of moet
a hard time sip your juice and watch a smooth poet
i take 7 mc's put 'em in a line
and add 7 more brothas who think they can rhyme
well it'll take 7 more before i go for mine
now that's 21 mc's ate up at the same time
easy does it do it easy that's what i'm doin'
no fessin' no messin' around no chewin'
no robbin' no buyin' bitin' why bother
this slob'll stop tryin' fightin' to follow
my unusual style will confuse you a while
and if i was water i'd flow in the nile
so many rhymes you won't have time to go for yours
just because of applause i have to pause
right after tonight is when i prepare
to catch another sucka duck mc out there
'cause my strategy has to be tragedy catastrophe
and after this you'll call me your majesty
my melody

yes my melody
eric b

marley marl synthesized it i memorize it
eric b made a cut and advertised it
my melody's created for mc's in the place
they try to listen 'cause i'm dissin them so pick up your face
shook off your neck 'cause you try to detect my pace
now you're buggin' almost doggin' off my rhyme-like bass
the melody that i'm stylin' smooth as a violin
rough enough to break new york from long island
my wisdom is swift no matter if
my momentum is slow mc's still stand stiff
i'm genuine like leather - inclined to be clever
mc you'll beat the r i'll say oh never
so eric b cut it easily and
check out my melody",1
3,"it's been a long time i shouldn't have left you
without a strong rhyme to step to
think of how many weak shows you slept through
time's up i'm sorry i kept you
thinking of this you keep repeating you miss
the rhymes from the microphone soloist
and you sit by the radio hand on the dial soon
as you hear it pump up the volume
dance wit the speaker till you hear it blow
then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
it's a 4 letter word when it's heard it control
your body to dance you got it soul
ditects the tempo like a red alert
reaches your reflex so let it work
when this is playing you can't get stuck wit
the steps so get set and i'm a still come up wit
a gift to be swift follow the leader the rhyme will go
def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
it can be done but only i can do it
for those that can dance and clap your hands to it
i start to think and then i sink
into the paper like i was ink
when i'm writing i'm trapped in between the lines
i escape when i finish the rhyme
i got soul

you got it 4x
i know you got soul

picture a mic the stage is empty
a beat like this might tempt me
to pose show my rings and my fat gold chain
grab the mic like i'm on soul train
but i'll wait 'cause i mastered this
let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
eric b break the sticks you got it
rakim will begin when you make the mix
i'll experiment like a scientist
you wanna rhyme you gotta sign my list
'cause i'm a manifest and bless the mic i hold
you want it next? then you gotta have soul
'cause if you ain't got it i'm a make an encore
take the mic make the people respond for
the r 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
if you wanna get on after me
think about it wait erase your rhyme
forget it and don't waste your time
'cause i'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
drop the mic you shouldn't be holding it
this is how it should be done
this style is identical to none
some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
so upset that i'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
i drip steam like a microphone fiend
eager to mc is my theme
i get hype when i hear a drum roll
rakim is on the mic and you know i got soul

you got it 5x

i got soul you got it that's why i came
to teach those who can't say my name
first of all i'm the soloist the soul controller
rakim gets stronger as i get older
constant elevation causes expansion
i write my rhyme while i cool in my mansion
then put it on tape and in the city i test it
then on the radio the r's requested
you listen to it the concept might break you
'cause almost anyone can relate to
whoever's out of hand i'm give him handles
light 'em up blow 'em out like candles
or should i just let him melt?
then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
i'm not bold just 'cause i rock gold
rakim is on the mic and you know i got soul

you got it 4x

now i'm a stop to see what you got
get off the mic before i get too hot
i want to see which posse can dance the best
it should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
now if your from uptown brooklyn- bound
the bronx queens or long island sound
even other states come right and exact
it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
since you came here you have to show and prove
and do that dance until it don't move
'cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release
the rest is up to you rakim'll say peace

you got it 10x",1
4,"verse one

standing by the speaker suddenly i had this
fever was it me or either summer madness
'cause i just can't stand around
so i get closer and the closer i get the better it sound
my mind starts to activate rhymes collaborate
'cause when i heard the beat i just had to make
something from the top of my head
so i fell into the groove of the wax and i said
how could i move the crowd
first of all ain't no mistakes allowed
here's the instruction put it together
it simple ain't it but quite clever
some of you been trying to write rhymes for years
but weak ideas irritate my ears
is this the best that you can make?
'cause if not and you got more i'll wait
but don't make me wait too long 'cause i'm a move on
the dancefloor when they put something smooth on
so turn up the bass it's better when it's loud
'cause i like to move the crowd

move the crowd

verse two

imagine me wit the heat that's made by solar
it gets stronger every time i hold a
microphone check the tone to get started
the line for the microphone is departed
so leave it up to me my dj is mixing
everyone is moving or eager to listen
your hands in the air your mouth shut
'cause i'm on the mic and eric b is on the cut
for those that know me indeed i like to flow
especially when the music's going slow
it gives me a chance to let everybody know
it's time to bust out the rakim show
i'm the intelligent wise on the mic i will rise
right in front of your eyes 'cause i am a surprise
so i'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
all praise due to allah and that's a blessing
wit knowledge of self there's nothing i can't solve
at 360 degrees i revolve
this is actual fact it's not an act it's been proven
indeed and i proceed to make the crowd keep moving

move the crowd",1

new color new dimension new value

coldcut scratches lead in 2x
thinking of a master plan
def with record def with the record

thinking of a master plan
'cause ain't nothing but sweat inside my hand
so i dig into my pocket all my money is spent
so i dig deeper but still coming up with lint
so i start my mission leave my residence
thinking how could i get some dead presidents?
i need money i used to be a stick-up kid
so i think of all the devious things i did

coldcut scratches interlude 2x
i used to roll up roll up roll up

i used to roll up this is a hold up ain't nothing funny
stop smiling be still don't nutin' move but the money
but now i learned to earn 'cause i'm righteous
i feel great so maybe i might just
search for a 9 to 5 if i strive
then maybe i'll stay alive
so i walk up the street whistling this
feeling out of place 'cause man do i miss
a pen and a paper a stereo a tape of
me and eric b and a nice big plate of
fish which is my favorite dish
but without no money it's still a wish
'cause i don't like to dream about getting paid
so i dig into the books of the rhymes that i made
so now to test to see if i got pull
hit the studio 'cause i'm paid in full

was it good enough for you?",1
6,"knowledge will begin until i finish this song
cause the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on
you sweat as you step about to get hype
or should you just listen to the man on the mic
you're physically in this with me but how could you tell
if it's meant to be hip-hop if you're not mentally as well
ready to absorb the rhyme that i just poured
into the mic and so unite and this won't be so bored
if you just keep kickin' listen - to the mix
and think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
holds and controls you till i leave
you fall deeper in the style - it's hard to breathe
the only time i stop is when somebody drop and then
bring 'em to the front cause my rhymes' the oxygen
then wave your hands - when you're ready i'll send you
into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue
and so on and i'ma go on simultaneously
and even if i stop - the rhyme remains to be
rising to the top - and i came to drop it
catch it and quiz it - is my topic
universual cause i move everybody to come
by exercising your mind you'll coincide as one
you look around and see how packed the party starts to get
i draw a crowd - like an architect
the five borroughs react and all the islands attract
and every state can't wait - so they attack
off a spot on the floor - squeeze in 'cause it's packed
it'll be more room if mc's play the back
i'm the r the a to the k-i-m
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
the microphone fiend if i was a fake
whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes i make
i had you biting your tongue for what i brung and recite
sung it on stage some said it don't sound like

the voice on the record - i see what you mean
because the system was wack so i had to scream
so just - give me a mic if it's loud i'll blow it
if not - into the crowd i'll throw it
pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well
before i let go i'ma spark your brain cells
i took time to write - tonight i will recite
so poetically inclined when the mic is held tight
rhymes start flowin' kisses are blowin'
mc's are knowin' that's why they're goin'
home to tell a friend when the party ends
yo man you know rakim? that brother struck again
'cause mic by mic and stage by stage
tape by tape and page by page
when the crowd is moving i compete with the mix
the rougher the cuts - the rougher the rhyme gets
deeper and deeper - i hope you understand it
i made it up myself and i planned it
for other mc's who waste time
writing jokes riddles and maybe a rhyme
i cross my arms and i was waiting - but i was hating
the rappers on the microphone was fronting - just faking
they wasn't breakin' which means i was achin'
to get up on the microphone and then start takin'
control of the mic - uptight when i grabbed it
so hug the speaker- your ear's a magnet
attracted to a freestyle put in effect
you listen to my man while you're sippin' moet
so eric pick up the needle yeah put it in the middle ahhight
give me a scratch turn my mic up a little
i want you to hear this perfectly clear
catch what i'm sayin' you get the idea?
i hope you knowledge the beginning 'cause i'm finished this song
the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on",1
8,"i came in the door i said it before
i never let the mic magnetize me no more
but it's biting me fighting me inviting me to rhyme
i can't hold it back i'm looking for the line
taking off my coat clearing my throat
the rhyme will be kicking it until i hit my last note
my mind remains to find all kinda ideas
self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
but still say a rhyme after the next one
prepared never scared i'll just bless one
and you know that i'm the soloist
so eric b make 'em clap to this

i don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
no tricks in '86 it's time to build
eric b easy on the cut no mistakes allowed
'cause to me mc means move the crowd
i made it easy to dance to this
but can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
say indeed then i proceed 'cause my man made a mix
if he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
his fingertips so i rhyme until there's no rhymes left
i hurry up because the cut will make him bleed to death
but he's kicking it 'cause it ain't no half steppin'
the party is live the rak can't be kept inside
if he's eruptin' just like a volcano
it ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme
'cause i'm better then the rest of them
eric b is on the cut and my name is rakim

go get a girl and get soft and warm
don't get excited you've been invited to a quiet storm
but now it's out of hand 'cause you told me you hate me
and then you ask what have i done lately
first you said all you want is love and affection
let me be your angel and i'll be your protection
take you out buy you all kinds of things
i must of got you too hot and burned off your wings
you caught an attitude you need food to eat up
i'm scheming like i'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up
you scream i'm lazy you must be crazy
thought i was a donut you tried to glaze me

well now you're forced to listen to the teacher and the lesson
class is in session so you can stop guessin
if this is a tape or a written down memo
see i am a professional this is not a demo
in fact call it a lecture a visual picture
sort of a poetic and rhythm-like mixture
listen i'm not dissin but there's somethin' that you're missin'
maybe you should touch reality stop wishin
for beats with plenty bass and lyrics said in haste
if this meaning doesn't manifest put it to rest
i am a poet you try to show it yet blow it
it takes concentration for fresh communication
observation that is to see without speaking
take off your coat take notes i am teachin
a class or rather school cause you need schooling
i am not a king or queen i'm not ruling
this is an introduction to poetry
a small dedication to those that might know of me
they might know of you and maybe your gang
but one thing's for sure neither one of y'all can hang
cause yo i'm like a arrow and scott is the crossbow
say something now  thought so
you seem to be the type that only understand
the annihilation and destruction of the next man
that's not poetry that is insanity
it's simply fantasy far from reality
poetry is the language of imagination
poetry is a form of positive creation
difficult isn't it? the point? you're missin' it
your face is in front of my hand so i'm dissin it

verse two krs-one

scott larock is innovating decorating hip-hop
the beat may drop but not like all the others
they just cover while i just smother
every single stupid mutha -- wait wait brotha
krs-one will have to show another
mc or self-proclaimed king or queen
or gang or crew or solo or team
that i mean
business
so tell me what is this?
see i come from the bronx so just kiss this
boogie down productions is somewhat an experiment
the antidote for sucka mc's and they're fearin it
it's self-explanatory no one's writin for me
the poetry i'm rattlin is really not for battlin
but if you want i will simply change the program
so when i'm done you will simply say damn
so this conversation is somewhat hypothetical
boogie down productions attempts to prove somethin'
i say hypothetical because it's only theory
my theory so take a minute now to hear me

verse three krs-one

so what's your problem?
it seems you want to be krs-two
from my point of view backtrack stop the attack
'cause krs-one means simply one krs
that's it that's all solo single no more no less
i've built up my credential financially and mental
anytime i rhyme i request the instrumental
i speak clearly and that's merely
or should i say a mere help to my career
i'm really not into fashion or craze
just the one who pays and how soon i get a raise
you're probably in a daze acting out of sympathy
wrote a couple of rhymes and think that you can get with me
but what a pity i'm rockin' new york city
and everywhere else you put the jams on the shelf
you as an amateur is outspoken
i'm looking at your face you seem to be hopin
that i might stutter stop or just mess up
but everything's live that's why i don't dress up
blastmaster krs a synonym for fresh
i'm the teacher of the class i do not pass no test
got dj scott larock by my side not in back of me
'cause we make up the boogie down productions crew faculty
get it right or train yourself not to bite
'cause when you bite you have bitten when i hear it that's it
i do not contemplate a battle cause it really ain't worth it
i'd rather point a pistol at your head and try to burst it

i'm teaching poetry
i'm teaching poetry

we're teaching po-e-try",1

krs word yo what-up d-nice?
d-nice yo wassup scott la rock?
slr yo man we chillin' this funky fresh jam i wanna tell
you a little somethin' about us we're the boogie down
productions crew and due to the fact that no one else out there
knew what time it was we have to tell you a little story about
where we come from

south bronx the south south bronx 4x

many people tell me this style is terrific
it is kinda different but let's get specific
krs-one specialized in music
i'll only use this type of style when i choose it
party people in the place to be krs-one attacks
ya got dropped off mca cause the rhymes you wrote was wack
so you think that hip-hop had it's start out in queensbridge
if you popped that junk up in the bronx you might not live
'cause you're in

south bronx the south south bronx 4x

i came with scott larock to express one thing
i am a teacher and others are kings
if that's a title they earn well it's well deserved but
without a crown see i still burn
you settle for a pebble not a stone like a rebel
krs-one is the holder of a boulder money folder
you want a fresh style let me show ya
now way back in the days when hip-hop began
with coque larock kool herc and then bam
beat boys ran to the latest jam
but when it got shot up they went home and said damn
there's got to be a better way to hear our music every day
beat boys gettin' blown away but comin' outside anyway
they tried again outside in cedar park
power from a street light made the place dark
but yo they didn't care they turned it out
i know a few understand what i'm talkin' about
remember bronx river rollin' thick
with kool dj red alert and chuck chillout on the mix
when afrika islam was rockin' the jams
and on the other side of town was a kid named flash
patterson and millbrook projects
casanova all over ya couldn't stop it
the nine lives crew the cypress boys
the real rock steady takin' out these toys
as odd as it looked as wild as it seemed
i didn't hear a peep from a place called queens
it was seventy-six to 1980
the dreads in brooklyn was crazy
you couldn't bring out your set with no hip-hop
because the pistols would go
so why don't you wise up show all the people in the place that you are wack
instead of tryna take out ll you need to take your homeboys off the crack
'cause if you don't well then their nerves will become shot
and that would leave the job up to my own scott larock
and he's from

south bronx the south south bronx 8x

the human tr-808 d-nice
the poet the blastmaster krs-one
the grand incredible dj scott la rock

he said i had his girl i said now what are you? stupid?
but he tried to play me out and krs-one knew it
he reached for his pistol but it was just a waste

but seven days too much when the gossip has to circulate
puffin sensemilla i heard knock knock knock
but the way that they knocked it did not sound like any cop
and if it were a customer they'd ask me for a nick
so suddenly i realized it had to be a trick
i dropped down to the floor and they did not waste no time
they shot right through the door so i had to go for mine
they pumped and shot again but the suckas kept on missin'
'cause i was on the floor by now i crawled into the kitchen
thirty seconds later boy they bust the door down
the money and the sensemi' was lyin' all around
but just as they put their pistols down to take a cut
me jumped out the kitchen went buck buck buck
they fall down to the floor but one was still alive
so i put my 9 millimeter right between his eyes
looked at his potnah and both of them were dead
so just before he joined his potnah this is what i said

la la-la la-la la-la la la la la la x2

i gathered all the money and i ran up the block
i said this is a perfect time to meet with scott larock
but scott is either psychic or he has a knack for trouble
'cause scott larock showed up in a all-black bmw
i jumped inside the car and we screeched off in a hurry
and scott said what is wrong? relax tell me the story
i said you remember peter? well his posse tried to kill me
i'm all right now because the sensemi' fill me
scott just laughed he said i know they're all dead

dj scott larock and i krs-one
our mother's first son and no we'll never run
from complex situations like you t-o-y-s's
always talkin' junk yet in jail you're rockin' dresses
i have arrived for the purpose of joy
unlike any ordinary bronx b-boy
i will volunteer my services and launch an attack
on you fake educators with your yakety-yak
this is a fact the teacher is here now in the flesh
consistently hounded by you mc pests
if you really want to learn from me
don't waste time in burnin me
'cause ignorance and inexperience does not concern me
i will emphasize so you will realize and come alive
never close your eyes never sleep or you might take a dive
many people hate me many people love me
some are far below me
and you know there's some above me
but this my hypothesis to conclude the story
all you fake mc's on a mission you bore me
i'm the blastmaster krs on the mic
watchin all these females rock their pants too tight
'cause there's no other creative composition on display
that give a full analysis and rock this way
you will pay eventually you all will decay
while the dj scott larock will continue to play
cuttin' records drivin' cars and you'll know who we are
make a mix just for kicks
and you'll be on our tip
and oh yes there's a highlight to the show of course
you hear dj scott larock go off go off

scott la rock go off go off x8

boogie down productions no reduction to its title
if you have a headache toys go and take a midol
we have arrived for the purpose of enjoyment
you have arrived to make up for unemployment
you're on it only 'cause i learned just how to flaunt it
i breathed a rhyme upon you like a sickness and you caught it
quick get off the tip trick you must be sick
like a doctor here's my bill i wrote it out with a bic
signed my name upon the bottle 'cause you know i just rocked em
but gettin' into battles really isn't my thing

my name is at the top of all of those that mix
i'm turnin' poetry into cash for eighty-seven
some did it got paid some jams were never played
but i am just a poet who watched the whole parade
go by and why? 'cause they wasn't fly
others claim to be fresh but they're not krs
i cannot walk around the street with my head in the clouds
either runnin' on my gear or havin' colors too loud
everything must coincide with the way i feel
and by the way it's scott larock on the wheels of steel
so i take one step to adjust the mic
i get around the whole city so i do wear nike
i like a funky beat a studio like unique
i write the crazy fresh lyrics and i don't eat meat
you can look me up and down and my dj too
because we make up the boogie down productions crew
takin' out mc's - on the 1 2 3
no matter who they claim to be in society
because we know their games we have pulled their file
if they need a different style we can get wild
he's icu he's out to kill
i'm krs and we get ill
dj scott larock got his own beat
the extravagant life is what we seek
i will tell you like this 'cause i know for a fact
i will live a long life and i don't smoke crack
captivatin the crowd seven days a week
you know what they told me to say? i got the dope beat

for me to say again another verse of my rhyme
means what you heard before must've blew up your mind
so now it's time to find poetry like mine
do not waste all your time because i'm one-of-a-kind
pullin out easy goin' cause the money be flowin
6'4 brown eyes and i'm always showin
stupid mc's on the mic the way it 'posed to be done
they study rhymes all week but i be rhymin for fun
when they lose they get upset always pullin a gun
but they will snap out of that because i'm krs-one
not two not three but o-n-e
get it right the first time i won't repeat this rhyme
if you think that you can burn me with your amateur ways
keep in mind that i been out there from back in the days
i don't braaaaaaaaag about the people i know
because they're still bluffin they're not givin' me nothin'
i can walk around the city with the rhymes i flaunt
cause no matter how you front they're still the ones you want
see i am funky fresh and poetry is my opinion
takin' out you suckers while the scott larock is spinnin

 guitar interlude 

my name is krs-one i'm still kinda young
i don't wear adidas cause my name ain't run
got nike's on my feet and to be complete
i can rock an american or reggae beat
got rhymes for 70's 80's and 90's
not bein conceited but it won't pay to try me
out to any feud any battle any reason
make the rhymes up every season this style i'm just teasin
pick up the pace homeboy pick up the pace
you're way behind schedule listen to what i'm tellin' you
this particular style may vary
the things i converse about are heard rarely
some can't bear me others try to scare me
soundin intelligent but not yet equivalent

he is the super hoe

verse one krs-one

scott larock is for now the main topic
not looking at his cuts or cash flow of the pocket
you may not realize it or you may not know
but uh he is the super hoe
when i say super i'm not exaggeratin
datin for a guy like scott turns into matin
he seems to be quiet but i don't buy it
proof is in the puddin' why don't you just try it
the super hoe is loose in your section
and he's armed with a powerful erection
so grab your girl and run for protection
your momma too 'cause i like to mention

super sperm 4x

verse two krs-one

whatever you could do or say inside a bed
scott larock has done and most likely said
he doesn't argue with a girl cause yes he has others
keep updated on all kind of rubbers
got ones that are lambskin others that are plastic
one day he'll open a school for prophylactics
they don't know he is the super hoe
up in rochester on dkx
wdkx now dk-sex
we were bein interviewed there live on air
every girl in the city scott had an affair
km in the am had asked his last question
but scott larock said wait i gotta mention
the fact that i'm single i like to mingle
and one more time bust the fresh jingle

super sperm 4x

verse three krs-one

in the field of music i'll always pass by
girls that claim to act so fly
they always act like it's all about them or their friends
but according to scott they all like to bend
yes fly girls shy girls black girls white girls
in eighty-seven it's got to be the right girl
if you claim to have a little problem
well scott larock knows just how to solve em
if you're a guy a nine'll do the trick
but if you're a girl you need some flowers
i admit scott has strange powers
enticing girls in less than an hour
or should i say minutes? i seen how he did it
he probably says i'm scott larock and she's with it
so whether he's a gigolo tramp or pro he is the super hoe
now many people have their ways of expressin
what they do best for scott it's undressin
yes either a girl or some date for the night
he doesn't want to hear that you're too tight
so do not think that scott larock is mean
it's not his fault he'll give you vaseline
the super hoe is loose in your area
makin' life for girls a little scarier
so if you got a radio tryin' to tape this
do not keep in mind that he is a rapist
for the super hoe to be chillin'
another female out there has to be willin'
so all you tramps and hoes raise your hand
'cause super hoe scott larock understands
if you're a guy we'll talk about hangin'
and if you're a girl he'll talk about bangin'
if your moms call up well i don't know
but uh he is the super hoe

verse one krs-one

criminal minded you've been blinded
lookin' for a style like mine you can't find it
they are the audience i am the lyricist
sometimes the suckas on the side gotta hear this
page a rage and i'm not in a cage
free as a bird to fly up out on stage
ain't here for no frontin just to say a little somethin'
ya suckaz don't like me 'cause you're all about nothin'
however i'm really fascinating to the letter
my all-around performance gets better and better
my english grammar comes down like a hammer
you need a style i need to pull your file
i don't beg favors you're kissing other people's ---
i write and produce myself just as fast
keep my hair like this got no time for jheri curls
attractin only women got no time for little girls

krs sings again cause girls look so good
but their brain is not ready i don't know
i'd rather talk to a woman
cause her mind is so steady so here we go

i'm not a musical maniac or b-boy fanatic
i simply made use of what was upstairs in the attic
i've listened to these mc's back when i was a kid
but i bust more shots than they ever did
i mean this is not the best of krs it's just a section
but how many times must i point you in the right direction
you need protection when i'm on the mic
because my mouth is like a 9 millimeter windpipe
you're a king i'm a teacher
you're a b-boy i'm a scholar
if this was a class well it would go right under drama
see kings lose crowns but teachers stay intelligent
talkin' big words on the mic but still irrelevant
especially when you're not college material
wake up every morning to your lucky charms cereal
dj scott larock has a college degree
blastmaster krs writes poetry
i won't go deeper in the subject cause that gets me bored
it's a shame to know some mc's on the mic are fraud
sayin' styles like this to create a diss
but if you listen who you dissin?
see i am a musician
rappin' on the mic like this to me is fine
'cause if i really want to battle i will put out a nine
you can see that scott larock and i are mentally binded
in other words we're both criminal minded

verse two krs-one

we're not promoting violence we're just havin' some fun
he's scott larock i'm krs-one
never off-beat cause it don't make sense
grab the microphone relaxed and not tense
you waited debated and now you activated
a musical genius that could not be duplicated
see i have the formula for rockin' the house
if you cannot rock a party do not open your mouth
it's that simple no phony cosmetics to your pimple
take another look because the gear is not wrinkled
the k the r the s the o the n the e
sayin' rhyme for eighty-seven not from 1983
well versed to rehearse and my rhymes are my curse
originality come first but the suckers get worse
allow me to include i have a very stable mood
poetic education of a high altitude
i'm not an mc so listen call me poet or musician
a genius when it comes to making music with ambition
i'm cool collected with the rhyme i directed
don't wanna be elected as the king of a record
just respected by others as the man with the solution
an artist of the 80's came and left his contribution
on wax relax there's 24 tracks
after years of rocking parties now i picked up the knack
because everything that flows from out my larynx
takes years of experience and bottles of beck's
i cannot seem to recollect the time i didn't have sex
is it real or is it memorex?
i'm livin' in a city known as new york state
sucka mc's gotta wait while i translate
i hang with real live dreads with knowledge in their heads
people with ambition and straight up musicians
although our lives have been so uprooted
i have it included you all get zooted
so take each letter of the krs-one
means knowledge reigns supreme over nearly everyone
you look at me and laugh but this is your class
it's an all-out discussion of the suckas i be crushin
so now you are awakened to the music i be makin'
never duplicated and also highly cultivated
don't get frustrated cause nothin' has been traded
only activated it came out very complicated
not separated from my dj
you see my voice is now faded
i'll see you folks around the way

for a play not your everyday ? trey?

i glance at the paper to know what's going on
someone's doing wrong the story goes on
mary lue just had a baby someone else decapitated
the drama of the world shouldn't keep us so frustrated
i look but it doesn't coincide with my books
social studies won't speak about political crooks
it's just the presidents and all the money they spent
all the things they invent and how the house is so immaculate
they create missiles while family's eat gristle
then they get upset when the press blows the whistle
phone calls are made profiles are kept low
you temper with some jobs now the press is controlled
not only newspapers but every single station
you only get to hear the president is on vacation
but um stay calm there's no need for alarm
you say good bye to your mom and you're off to vietnam
you shoot to kill come back and you're a veteran
but how many veterans are out there pedaling?
there's no telling 'cause they continue selling
as quiet as it's kept i won't go into depth
you can talk about nigeria people used to laugh at ya
now i take a look i see usa for africa?

huh
what's the solution to stop all this confusion?
rewrite the constitution change the drug which you're using
rewrite the constitution or the emancipation proclamation
we fight inflation yet the president's still on vacation

well here's the reason i came to you
we gotta put our heads together and stop the violence
cause real bad boys move in silence
when you're in a club you come to chill out
not watch someone's blood just spill out
that's what these other people want to see
another race fight endlessly
you know we're being watched you know we're being seen
some wish to destroy this scene called hip-hop
but i won't stop
not i or scott larock
now here is the message that we bring today
hip-hop will surely decay
if we as a people don't stand up and say
stop the violence
stop the violence

what?
can i have your attention?
mn-hmm
there's just a few things that i've got to mention uh-huh
there's girlies out here that seem appealing
they'll come in your life and cold hurt your feelings
i'm telling you
as sure as rick is my name
i wouldn't trust not girl unless she feels the same
treat 'em like a prostitute do what?
don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'cause all they do is they hurt and trample
listen up close here comes my first example

now ya been with your girlfriend for quite a while
plans for the future she's having your child
celebrate with friends drinking cans and quarts
tell all your friends about your family thoughts
one friend was drunk so he starts to act wild
he tells the truth about the kid
it's not your child
acting like a jerk and on his face was a smirk
he said your wife went berserk while you was hard at work
and she led him on and tried to please him
she didn't waste time she didn't try to tease him

treat 'em like a prostitue do what?
don't treat no girlie well treat no girlie well treat no girlie well until
you're sure of the scoop
'cause all they do is they hurt and trample
listen up close here comes my second example

it's your wife
you buy the tramp jewels and clothes
you get sentimental and bring home a rose
give her everything 'cause you swear she's worth it
all your friends tell you the bith don't deserve it
love is blind so there goes your wealth
until one day you see things for yourself
home from work early mr loverman
you had a card and some candy in your right hand
there's the mailman he was short yet stout
he went inside your house and didn't come back out
bust it
just a friendly stop come on is it?
the mailman comes and he pays your wife a visit?
the thought alone makes your temperature boil
you say to yourself she might still be loyal
you open up your door and stand in a trance
you see the mailman's bag and the mailman's pants
came home to party
from work had a hard day
look around your house and you say where the fuck are they?
run upstairs up to your bedroom
you look inside your room you see something brewin'
cover your mouth because you almost choke
you see the mailman's dick way up your wife's throat

treat 'em like a prostitute mm-hmm
don't treat no girlie well treat no girlie well treat no girlie well until
you're sure of the scoop
'cause all they do is they hurt and trample
listen up close here comes my third example

now your girl she don't like to have sex a lot
today she's ready and she's hot hot hot
as you open up the door she says get on the floor
she wants to try things she's never tried before
she takes off your drawers and works you over
she calls you twinkles
and you call her rover
next thing you know the ho starts to ill
she says i love you harold and your name is will
that's not the half till you start to ride her
take off your rubber and there's one more inside her
it's not yours-who can it be?
i think it was a slick rapper his name is mc ricky

treat 'em like a prostitute
don't treat no girlie well treat no girlie well
treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop",1
1,"hauk who goes yonder?
it is i sire richard of nottingham
well speak up man what is it?
news from the east sire rick the ruler has returned

gather 'round party goers as if your still livin'
and get on down to the old slick rhythm
now this one here is called the ruler my dear
it's a mere party booster that will set things clear
it's a hundred percent proof from champions of truth
and if you feel you need spirit i'll bring back your youth
relax your mind and folks unwind
and be kind to a rhythm that you hardly find
and off we go let the trumpets blow
well hold on because the driver of the mission is a pro
the ruler's back

now in these times at least to me
there's a lot of people out here tryin' to sound like ricky d
not tryin' to cause trouble cause its really a small thing
but they're bitin what i'm writin
god it's great being the king
some sound all right but then they act illy
try conquering my crown and that's really very silly
now i'm not the type that gets upset
try to disrespect folks just to earn respect
but learn this fact whether white or black
i can't be conquered in my style of rap
for jealousy and envy are dumb ones tools
so ricky says nothing he keeps his cool
revenge is not a mission that the ruler's on
just forgiveness required for the wrong that's done
so off we go let the trumpets blow
and hold on because the driver of the mission is a pro
the ruler's back

now one day when i was chillin' at this outside jam
i seen folks havin' a ball and plus clappin' their hands
to beats of records that conquer the streets
like pee wee herman and clubhouse treats
girls was chillin' boys rule as usual
the slacks the golds the rings i hope i'm not confusin y'all
but everyone in the house looks smashin'
fresh clothes on their butts and nothing out of fashion
and just when you thought nothing couldn't get better
a news flash concealed in a bright yellow letter
a kid ran up to the mike and said alert hear this
cleared his cloggy throat and then began to persist
he said hallelujah kids hear this
the ruler's back and he's here to assist
so off we go let the trumpets blow
and hold on because the driver of the mission is a pro
the ruler's back",1
2,"uncle ricky would you read us a bedtime story please huh please?
yeah please?
alright you kids get to bed i'll get the story book
yeah alright
y'all tucked in?
yeah
here we go

once upon a time not long ago
when people wore pajamas and lived life slow
where laws were stern and justice stood
and people were behavin' like they ought to good
there lived a little boy who was misled
by another little boy and this is what he said
me and you tonight we're gonna make some cash
robbin' old folks and makin' the dash

they did the job money came with ease
but one couldn't stop it's like he had a disease
he robbed another and another stick 'em up stick 'em up 
and a sista and her brotha
tried to rob a man who was a dt undercover
the cop grabbed his arm he started actin' erratic
he said keep still boy no need for static

punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
but little did he know the little boy was strapped
the kid pulled out a gun he said why'd ya hit me?
the barrel set straight for the cop's kidney
the cop got scared the kid he starts to figure
i'll do years if i pull this trigga

so he cold dashed and ran around the block
cop radio's in to another lady cop
he ran by a tree there he saw this sista
shot for the head he shot back but he missed her
looked 'round good and from expectations
he decided he'd head for the subway stations

but she was coming and he made a left
he was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath
knocked an old man down and swore he killed him sorry
then he made his move to an abandoned buildin'
ran up the stairs up to the top floor
opened up a door there guess who he saw?
who?

dave the dope fiend shootin' dope
who don't know the meanin' of water nor soap
he said i need bullets hurry up run
the dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun

he went outside but there was cops all over
then he dipped into a car a stolen nova
raced up the block doin' 83
crashed into a tree near university
escaped alive though the car was battered
rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
ran outta bullets and he still had static
grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
pointed at her head he said the gun was fulla lead
he told the cops back off or honey here's dead

deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
so he let the lady go and he starts to run on
uh huh
sirens sounded he seemed astounded
and before long the little boy got surrounded
he dropped his gun so went the glory
and this is the way i have to end this story

he was only what? 
seventeen
in a madman's dream
the cops shot the kid i still hear him scream
this ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
uh huh
just another case about the wrong path
uh huh
straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
good night

talk about the box rick
talk about rick

oh boy that uncle ricky he's really weird
i know right what does he mean straight and narrow or your soul gets cast?
i don't know you'd think he'd be crackin' up too

my muscles kind of ache they felt rigid and stuff
so i looked around and i smoked this big fat spliff
now i'm happy as can be i'm in this pothead spell
i put some visine in my eyes so that no one can tell
it's 1255 almost time for the bell
put the breathmints in the mouth so that the mouth don't smell
now back on the job i don't bother no one
i keep strictly to myself and all my work gets done
now the job's finally over it's time to have fun
and i'm hangin' out with trevor there's a kid named john
got real drunker than a skunk and happy as can be
we went to the latin quarters and we got in free
scoopin all the girls like nuttin with my trunk jewelry
'cause i'ma fly brown brother and you can't school me
boogie down was performin hey they ain't no joke
and a bunch of brooklyn kids was lookin' all down my throat
was it my big chains with the big plates on em?
then they rolled on me and told me to run em

this was the moment i feared
hey yo homeboy take off your chains man
bout to hurt you real fuckin' bad i'm gonna fuck you up
this was the moment i feared
yo what's the matter stupid? take the shits off man
the fuck is up?

i said they're really not real they're just a front for the girls
then a whole bunch of fists just caved my world
i was in pain so ashamed i wish i had not came
had to kindly pick up my face and then ride home on the train then
i went to an open store that's where i brought/bought me a quart
then i went to the park and i sat and i thought
i seen danny boy though he's with his girl named sarah
in one of his cars i think this one's a bravera
she calls out to me but i really couldn't hear her
so i went just a little bit closer so i'd hear a little clearer
she said i need veronica blades that's right near tilden
i said i know where that's at cause that's right next to my building
i gave 'em the information and they went on their way
i went home and there i slept till almost three the next day
then someone knocked on my door i opened up no quit
it was sarah with some magazines and a bag named kit
she tried to use me and seduce me and at first i wasn't with it
then we did it and we did it and we did it and we did it
she said it was great she said she's glad we had done it
the elevator came and danny boy was on it

this was the moment i feared
hey yo what the fuck's goin' on here?
what you doin' to my girl homeboy?
this was the moment i feared
oh i just know y'all didn't just finish fuckin'
i just know y'all ain't just finish fuckin

well he was huffin and puffin and he swung at me -- word
so i pulled out my jammy and i silenced the nerd
then he was dead two in the head i took the cash and the visa's
she said don't worry about a thing just make sure nobody sees us
we went back to her apartment there was blow in the freezers
she said we're rich we're rich we can have whatever will please us
now i don't hang with no one who ain't good for my health
so i put the sugarhead out and i went for self
now i was rich as i was rich i could have whatever would please me
now i could wear real gold in front of folks that would tease me
yah me i'll be a new neighborhood dad
cats'll roll up on me screamin yo rick my man
i guess i was too fly word up i'm sorry to say
ya see a cop rolled up on me and told me make my day
i said relax brother but he had proof that i had done it
yah they had false hair on underwear with my fingerprints all on it
this was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
and i was the main event on the tv for a while
but now i'm in jail doin' life and i'm scared
some kids snuffed me cold and greased me where no one dared

this was the moment i feared
turn around nigga hahahaha
spread your cheeks
this was the moment i feared

well he's in indian town and what spots his eye?
a nice looking indian and honey looked fly
he had to talk because he just couldn't hack it
she wore some moccasins and plus a tough leather jacket
he trotted over and invented a line
he said excuse me um do you happen to have the time?
all was on his mind was sex sex sex
so she said why do ask? you got your own timex
to poor old dave that line was cold blooded
he felt that her ego was way over flooded
she started to laugh and then she started to say
i'm sorry some times i do get carried away
i didn't mean to like ill treat you
my name is running rabbit and i'm glad to meet you
he said i'm dave with crazy clout
oh you're the one the girls keep talking about
yeah you must be because you look like a winner
come to my house we'll discuss it over dinner

singing
davy davy crockett king of the wild frontier

well he met her father big chief beretti
he said what's for dinner?
soup and spaghetti
the dinner was rotten and he swore he's gonna puke it
he never would have took it if he'd known that he had cooked it
later on they were chilling in the bedroom
sitting at the window looking at the moon
judging from the mood he swore she was hot
he said are you in the mood?
she said no i'm not
from what he believes and from what he gets
when a girl says no he really thinks she means yes
so he started touching her and coming out strong
whispering sweet nothings and singing a song
he said
singing i'm in the mood for love
simply because you're near me
funny but when you're near me
i'm in the mood don't mean to be rude
but i'm in the mood for love
she said oh dave you've got my poor back hurting
i want you but first close the curtain
he closed the curtain and also the doors
the next thing you knew it was off with those drawers

take it easy davy you're hurting me stop

well he was playing with her tits they were soft not lumpy
and then he cracked the legs like humpty-dumpty
he's fucking sucking also finger popping
he had no intention of stopping
crazy fun he did not want to leave
his head was between her tits and he could barely breathe
he had to toss turn turn toss
meanwhile he was riding her with crazy force
she was burning hot she said stop stop
he said are you talking sex or what?
i guess she didn't realize what she started
next thing you knew she was acting retarded
she said to him strangely and kind of merry
stop now or i'll be unable to marry
he didn't take her warning
he rode her till the morning
he rode that ass till the pussy started yawning

yawning sounds

he said what? wait his dick went weak
it said dave pussies ain't supposed to speak
he gathered his things he wanted to leave this place
but first he wanted to see the vagina face to face
he opened it up with his bare two thumbs
he seen crabs with spears and indian drums

verse one
hey sport here's a thought from the old school crew
a serious situation we all go through
it deals with your feelins so hear what i say
it's like a day when nothing seems to go your way
bust this two people they really like each other
he says their's no one else
and she claims there is no other
the feelins the same and you receive a notion
to reveal your inner thoughts and deeply hidden emotions

verse two
precious times hopin they won't end
tell your mother bout your lover
also your best friend
ya mighty proud while your holdin' their hand
boys yeah that's my woman and girls yeah that's my man
this person brings a certain warmth to your heart
and everything seems so great at the start
for she loves him and he also loves her
and it's hard to turn back to who the person you were
but later on problems start to occur
and the bond which combines y'all turns into a blur
for the feelins were the same now here's the score
you love them to much and they don't love you anymore
is your attitude a number
or because your not bein true
or maybe they're just plain sick of seein you
word now it might seem strange
you better take hints quick and make the right change

see just when you swore the ball was rollin'
they're gone and part of your hearts been stolen
get back on your feet with a hop and a skip
but no you'd rather go with this dead relationship
hangin' around and buyin them stuff
you see them every darn day yet don't see them enough
you follow them around and they claim your hawkin
when conversation comes you do all the talkin'
not to mention attention we all need a bit
beind your back their say yeah he's all up in my
they're gtin sick of you and quite annonyed
and if you had plans for the future they're now destroyed
you saw what was happenin' and you still let it
and if you ever let him make love to you girls you can forget it
sweetheart you been caught
an it'll spread around town faster then you thought
then breakup time an you receve the word
yo this is from the heart and i know that part hurts
get over it from now on don't take short slick
if it's not true love you shouldn't deal with it
just think of your future and what is to come

so be mature and put the boy to a home
and if your over 18 i wish you'd act like an adult
don't live in a world of hate hate hate
pull yourself together and get yourself straight
men don't steal hey most don't borrow
and if you smoke crack your kids will smoke crack tomorrow
so be more mature and kids do your chores
make your own money hey be proud that's yours
you know why? 'cause that's a man that's brains no spite
stayin' outta trouble when it comes in sight
and a man never misses a fight in god's sight
'cause righteous laws are overdue
and this is a message that the ruler rick threw and it's true

you know what you know what
we likes ta party we likes ta party

well i remember one night when the world was dead quiet
and out of nowhere some boy starts a riot
he tore my clothes i had to throw blows
a shotgun barrel was dead on my nose
i froze - it was big foot and the toes
yup a bunch of small timers that be it on my shows
surrounded the ruler with machetes too
they said um 'if you don't teach us how to rap you're through'
i said 'okay now let me go please'
i seen an officer - then the officer screamed 'freeze'
he said 'slick rick you okay?'
i had to play it off some girls were looking my way
so i smacked one in the face and told him 'i won't retire'
and many years from now i'll just be getting higher
for i am the master set and done
my name is ricky d and i'm the only one - so say

now when i was a lad my style was bad
so i had to use what little bit of knowledge that i had

i educate myself so i'm able to reach ya
answering the call of teacher teacher

shoot a motherfucker in a minute
i find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
so if you're at a show in the front row
i'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
you'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
but that shows me slut you're composed to
a crazy motherfucker from the street
attitude legit 'cause i'm tearin up shit
mc ren controls the automatic
for any dumb motherfucker that starts static
not a right hand 'cause i'm the hand itself
every time i pull a ak off the shelf
the security is maximum and that's a law
r-e-n spells “ren” but i'm raw
see 'cause i'm a motherfuckin villain
the definition is clear you're the witness of a killin'

to be beaten on and thrown in jail
we can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell

fuckin' with me 'cause i'm a teenager
with a little bit of gold and a pager
searchin' my car lookin' for the product
thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics

you'd rather see me in the pen
than me and lorenzo rollin' in a benz-o
beat up police out of shape
and when i'm finished bring me yellow tape

to tape off the scene of the slaughter
still gettin' swoll' off bread and water
i don't know if they fags or what
search a nigga down and grabbin' his nuts

fuck the police and ren said it with authority
because the niggas on the street is a majority
a gang that's wit' whoever i'm steppin'
and the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in

a stash box for the so called law
wishin' ren was a nigga that they never saw
lights all flashin' behind me
but they're scared of a nigga so they mace to blind me

but that shit don't work i just laugh
because it gives 'em a hint not to step in my path
to police i'm sayin' fuck you punk
readin' my rights and shit - it's all junk

pullin' out a silly club so you stand
with a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
but take off the gun so you can see what's up
and we'll go at it punk and i'ma fuck you up

make you think i'ma kick your ass

maybe it's because i kick so much butt

i kick ass or maybe it's 'cause i blast

rushin to the eject to put my shit in and play it
it's like apollo but i'm not an amateur
and i'm not givin' a fuck while i'm damagin ya
it's for the record so ren's lyrics is gonna spin it
and if there was a trophy involved i'll win it
possession is mine and i'm the holder
cause a nigga like ren don't give a fuck 'cause i'm older
so for you to step off would be wise
and say fuck it parental discretion is advised

[ice cube]
i be what is known as a bandit
you gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
'cause if you fail to see read it in braile
it'll still be funky - so what's next is the flex
of a genius my rapid-stutter-steppin if you seen this
dope you hope that i don't really mean this
but if played made the grade or high-top fade
it's not my trademark when i get loose in the dark
you guess it was a test of a different style
it's just another motherfucker on the pile
drivin' your ass with the flow of your tongue
you hung yourself short the after-knowledge was brung
to your attention by the hardest motherfuckin artist
that is know for lynchin any sucker in a minute
stagger 'em all
when i start flowin like niagara falls
ice cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle
move like a snake when i'm mad and then my tail rattle
i get low on the flow so let your kids know
when i bust parental discretion is a must

[eazy-e]
little did they know that i would be arrivin
and it's surprisin rockin' it from where i been
but it's the e here to take no mistake to be made
in the trade where funky ass records are bein played
fuck the regular yo as i get better the
bitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick
so i get 'em hot thinkin' they're gonna get it
as they sit rubbin their legs like a cricket
to you it may be funny but
there's no service of beef without money
so slip the c-note and you can choke
on a wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat
foreplay to me ain't shit
when you spread 'em i'm ready then you can get the dick
of the eaze if you can deal with the size
but if you can't parental discretion's advised

[unknown voice at the end after band breaks down]
shut the fuck up",1
6,"[dre] ah yeah yo ren yo ready to do this shit?
[ren] yeah dre let's rip shit up
[dre] hey yo yella boy why don't you kick me one of them

call this ? tell'em what yo name is?
[ren] yeah something like that
[dre] all right let's kick this shit on the one
kick it

ren
back by demand now it's big as fuck
because you as the public you should know what's up
compton's in the house was more than gold it was a hit
cause it was based on some crazy shit
so our final conclusion has been permitted
punks made us a target and knew that we'd hit it
but that was a part of showbizz
dre
hey yo homeboy why don't you tell'em what your name is?
ren
well for the record it's ren and for the street it's villain
and strapped with a gat it's more like matt dillon
on gunsmoke but not a man of the law
i'm just the baddest motherfucker that you ever saw
see i peep and then i creep on a fool
get my bloodpressure high but still stay cool
dig a grave of a nigga lookin' up to me
that really had the nerve that he could fuck with me
who was the man in the mass while i was waitin' to axe
you know it's mc ren kickin' mucho ass
gettin' respect in showbizz
hey yo homeboy [dre whassup ?] why don't you tell'em what yo name is?

dre
dre the motherfuckin' doctor bitch hopper
the sucker-motherfucker stopper
back with a vocal track that's a fresh one
so now let's get the motherfuckin' session
goin' flowin' it's time to start throwin'
rhymes so keep in mind all the suckers i'm blowin'
'cause i'm a start showin' the time
never sayin' i'm the best and just goin' for mine
unlike a lotta suckers who claim they're gettin' busy
when their records only make good frisbees
you need to stop runnin' off the mouth
stop and think before you put some whack bullshit out


it's not difficult in fact it's kinda simple
to create something funky that's original
you need to talk about the place to be
who you are what you got about a suck mc

[dre] oh yeah that's what i'm talkin' about ren
you know what i'm sayin' ?
[ren] yeah i know what you're sayin' dre but you
still ain't told'em enough man
[dre] all right all right
well let's kick one more verse right here all right
kick it

dre]+[ren
this is portable something to fuck with yo ear
ren and dre will appear when the sound is clear
to fuck it up like we always do and that's the trick
sayin' some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks
but it's an everyday thang
communicating to y'all with the compton slang
compton's back in the house and your apartment
so open your door by the way so we can start it
test the monitors and call this mic
cause the way we feel we're gonna fuck it up tonight
i got my mic in my hand with a hell of a grip
bitches screamin' and shit now it's a trip
waitin' for the grand finale or the end
or stupid rhymes set be dre and ren
well like a kid we get new shoes and go faster
smilin' like hell as we move past the
suckers the motherfuckers with the ego hype
'cause we're positive and they're on a negative type
and if think we're about to quit
motherfucker you ain't heard shit

[dre] yeah that shit was funky you know what i'm sayin' ren?
[ren] i know what you're sayin' this is mc ren and drdre
cold kickin' it in the place
[dre] ah yeah my mellow eazy e in the house
yella boy in the house
my boy ice cube
arabian prince cold rockin' shit
[ren] oh yeah hey i'm a say whassup to my homeboys from cnw
[dre] yeah hey yo ren whatta we gonna call this shit?

[ren] yeah something like that",1
7,"yo man there's a lot of brothers out there
flakin' and perpetratin' who scared to kick reality
yo dre you been doin' all this dope producin'
you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
so watchu want me to do?

i'm expressin' with my full capabilities
and now i'm livin' in correctional facilities
'cause some don't agree wit how i do this
i get straight and meditate like a buddhist
i'm droppin' flavour my behavior is hereditary
but my technique is very necessary
blame it on ice cube because he said it get funky
when you got a subject and a predicate
add it on a dope beat and it'll make ya think
some suckers just tickle me pink to my stomach
'cause they don't flow like this one
you know what i won't hesitate to diss one or two before i'm through
so don't try to sing this
some drop science well i'm droppin' english
even if yella makes it a cappella
i still express yo i don't smoke weed or sess
'cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
and brain damage on the mic don't manage nuttin
but makin' a sucker and you equal
don't be another sequel

express yourself
do it do
express yourself
oh do it

ice cube is not for the pop charts
so where should a brother like you start expressin' yourself?
my boy'll show you how yo dre
watup?
drop english right about now
gettin' back to the pg
that's program and it's easy
dre is back new jacks are made hollow
expressin' niggers subject because they like to follow the words
the style the trend the records i spin
again and again and again
yo y'all on the other end
watch a brother bringin' dope rhymes with no help
there's no fessin' or guessin' when i'm expressin' myself
it's crazy to see people be what society wants 'em to be
but not me
ruthless is the way togo they know
others say rhymes that fail to be original
or they kill where the hip-hop starts
forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
and those musicians that cuss at home
but scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
yeah they want reality but chu won't hear none
they rather exaggerate a little fiction
some say no to drugs and take a stand
but after the show they go lookin' for the dopeman
oh they ban my group from the radio 'here nwa'
they say 'hell no'
but chu know it ain't all about wealth
as long as you make a note to express yourself

express yourself
do it do
express yourself
oh do it

a lyricist yo dre is the name for it
to make somethin' dope on a record that's what he came for
kickin' reality over stand us up
but it's important to keep it in mind to express yourself
from the heart if you wanna start and move up the chart then
expression is big part of it
you ain't efficient when you flow you ain't swift
movin' like a tortise full o' rigor mortis
there's a little bit more to show
i got rhymes in my mind embedded like a embryo
a lesson all bout expression
and if you start fessin i got a smith 'n' weston for ya
i might ignore you're record because it has no bottom
i get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
it's dre on the mic gettin' physical
doin' the job nwa is the lynch mob
yes i'm macabre but chu know you need this
and the night i just gone just like a fetus
or tumor heres the rumour dre's in the neighbourhood and he's up to no good
when i start expressin myself yella slam me
'cause if i stay funky like dis i'm doin' damage
or i'ma be too hype and need a straightjacket
i got knowledge and other suckers lack it
so when you see dre a dj on the mic
ask what it's like it's like we gettin' hype tonight
'cause if i strike it ain't for your good health
but i won't strike if you just express yourself

express yourself
do it do
express yourself
oh do it",1
9,"intro girl ice cube

ice cube do you think you could give me some money to get
my hair done? how short's your hair right now?
well you know i get it done every week and i need my nails
done too look i'ma tell you like this

verse one

i ain't the one the one to get played like a pooh butt
see i'm from the street so i know what's up
on these silly games that's played by the women
i'm only happy when i'm goin' up in em
but you know i'm a menace to society
but girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
so i step to em with aggression
listen to the kid and learn a lesson today
see they think we narrow minded
'cause they got a cute face and big-behinded
so i walk over and say how ya doin'?
see i'm only down for screwin but you know
ya gotta play it off cool
'cause if they catch you slippin you'll get schooled
and they'll get you for your money son
next thing you know you're gettin' their hair and they nails done
fool and they'll let you show 'em off
but when it comes to sex they got a bad cough
or a headache it's all give and no take
run out of money and watch your heart break
they'll drop you like a bad habit
cause a brother with money yo they gotta have it
messin with me though they gets none
you can't juice ice cube girl 'cause i ain't the one

interlude one

girrrrrl you got to get these brothers for all the money
you can honey 'cause if they ain't got no money they can't
do nothin' for me but get out of my face

i know what you mean girl it ain't nothin' right jumpin' off
unless he got dollars

verse two

sometimes i used to wonder
how the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number
he's gettin' juiced for his ducats
i tell a girl in a minute yo i drive a bucket
and won't think nuttin of it
she can ride or walk either leave it or love it
i show her that i'm not the o the n-e say
i'm a ruthless n-i double-g a
'cause i'm gamin on a female that's gamin on me
you know i spell girl with a b
a brother like me is only out for one thing
i think with my ding-a-ling but i won't bring no
flowers to your doorstep when we goin' out
'cause you'll take it for granted no doubt
and after the date i'ma want to do the wild thing
you want lobster huh? i'm thinking burger king
and when i take you you get frustrated
you can't juice ice cube and you hate it
but you see i don't go nuts
over girls like you with the big ol butts
it start comin' out the pocket to knock it
but when the damage is done
you can only lay me girl you can't play me girl
for the simple fact that i ain't the one

interlude two

i don't care how they look if they got money
we can hook up but they ain't gettin' none

yeah i just make 'em think they gonna get some
play up they mind a lil bit and get that money

oh ice cube can i have some money pleeeease?

verse three

give you money why bother
cause you know i'm lookin' nothin' like your father
girl i can't be played or ganked
ganked means getting took for your bank
or your gold or your money or something
nine times outta ten she's giving up nothing
they get mad when i put it in perspective
but let's see if my knowledge is effective
to the brothas man they robbing you blind
'cause they fine with a big behind but pay it no mind
keep your money to yourself homie
and if you got enough game
you'll get her name and her number
without going under
you can't leave 'em and love and stay above em
i used to get no play now she stay behind me
'cause i said i had a benz 190
but i lied and played the one
just to get some now she feels dumb
to my homies it's funny
but that's what you get trying to play me for my money
now don't you feel used
but i don't give hoot huh because i knock boots
you shouldn't be so damn material
and try to milk ice cube like cereal
now how many times do i have to say it
'cause if i have to go get a gun
you girls will learn i don't burn
you think i'm a sucka but i ain't the one

but you said you love me
i don't see no rings on this finger
why you doin' me like this? i love you
yeah you love my money i got what i wanted -- beat it",1
11,"listen to this
eazy e yo ren
mc ren whassup?
eazy e take one mc ren yo hit it

mc ren
ruthless plenty of that and much more
so at the party ren is controllin the floor
that you step and do your danceroutine
it ain't a dream my man you're in a gangsta scene
with a villain doin' damage on a 24 track
with confusion to finish my conclusion
arhytomatic rhymes from a radio cat
you can't take what i got 'cause i'll be takin' it right back
ruthless gangsta cold killin'
you wanna know what it's means ? definition villain
with the stupid dope rhyme
so once you hear one line you can tell it's mine
with a baseball cap that's black that i'm wearin
and a look that keeps you all starin'
and wondering why i'm invincible
but when you hear my rhyme it's convincible
i don't take no shorts while i'm constructin the ground
that makes y'all move around to my hell of a sound
girls drool on me like a dyin'
drdre yo ren tell'em what they do when you start rhymin
i go to the party i hip a hop the spot
i dunno what it is but the girls get hot
aspirin like they're on fire and
their so-called boyfriends with'em are retirin
and for this reason i'm a walkin' threath
so when i'm on stage i wantssssht

eazy e quiet on tha set
light camera action
eazy e nwa take two

mc ren
now to get started with my musical profession
a gangsta or villain in mine is in session
the way that i'm referrin to this makes ya move ya butt
but don't stand in a daze yeah you should know what's up
anyway i keep the clappin along
'cause nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong
?? huh ?? i'm ??? who could ask for anything more
when nwa is cold rockin' the floor
like stupid actin' like a retard
waitin for a bumrush gettin' to the good part
it tips me so with temptation
writin my lyrics with this hyped information
just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines
eazy e boy you should have known by now it's mine
unpredictable keepin' you extremely enjoyed


it's irresistible meanin' that you can't avoid
and while i'm on stage look forward to sweat
but after i rip it up i wantssssht

eazy e quiet on tha set
light camera action
eazy e nwa take three

mc ren
i can be loud as hell think i will ? never
ssssht eazy e quiet on tha set yeah i like that better
?? huh ?? as what i can do ?? i think i earn respect
and if i didn't from you that's what i expect
'cause if it ain't ruff it ain't me
so who really cares how you want me to be
see i'm just me standin at the top of the pile
and doin' soft known tunes it ain't my style
and this concludes our program
of how nwa makes a ruthless jam
now first we take an average drum
give it to dre and the boy gets dumb
it's no secret that i sit alone at night
pick up a pad and pen and begin to write
all kinda lyrics that's promised to play
to make everybody say
they can be cold and ruthless no question about that
but sometimes it's more complicated
eazy e yo dre you know what i want you to do ?
public enemy bring that beat back bring that beat back

now mc ren is here workin like super glue
no matter what i do i'm always thinkin' o' you
'cause i'm the pusher supplyin the fix
and this jam's so dope it don't need a remix
but i'm makin' obstacles of enemy traps
to catch any mc's with the weak-ass raps
crucifyin their ?? huh ?? like just for usin' my name
the definition is pain but that's the thing o' the game
if they try to retreat i catch'em one at a time
'cause they're comittin a crime and still promotin a rhyme
so you're in the back of me just listen and learn
because you'll all get a chance or maybe a turn
now my sideman wants to give a preview
so at my next concert i wanna see you
there not sittin' in a chair
standin on yo feet with yo hand in the air
now i'm about to get out but i'll be back
but next time expect the more funkier track
deep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion
with lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion
the beat that i'm ?? hype ?? and you know that's bad
now continue to dance 'cause i'm through with tha set",1

the bass makes my eardrums seem thin
def sounds in my ride yes the front and back

'cause i drive up to the ave with the windows closed
and my bass is so loud it could rip your clothes

1,"hey man i've seen ya think ya rockin' it on the floor?
you look like a moron who let you in the door?
to put the question bluntly maybe your feet's deformed
they should slap you in the teeth when you put your dancing shoes on
you can't dance

why don't you just snap your feet to the floor?
homeboy what's the use?
anytime you wanna step inside a party
first think of an excuse
you dance like a fat old lady
not sayin' that fat old ladies ain't nice
but every time you try to get one move right
the old lady then did it twice
you can't dance

you've been a dancing disco disaster
the worst i ever saw
they should dropkick you in the neck
and drag you off the floor
in every discotech i see you there
in the middle of the crowd
looking like you got eight or nine left feet dragging all around
you can't dance

take my advice don't move
you'll never get the knack
if i danced like you i'd sneak out the party
and wouldn't be coming back
on the floor you're a dinosaur yeah boy that's how you move
you look like ralph cramden ? or a donald duck cartoon
you can't dance

you wanna come to my party?
i wouldn't give you a chance
you tried to take breakdance lessons
ended up in an ambulance
wouldn't it be funny if they put you on solid gold?
you dance like you got arthritis already
what'll happen when you get old?
you can't dance

why are you so stiff?
is it something that your mother did?
maybe you grew up around can't dance people
when you were a can't dance kid
you live in a can't dance house
went out with a can't dance car
your doofy can't dance father
got drunk in a can't dance bar
you take a can't dance bath
put on your can't dance cologne
go out to a can't dance party
so you wouldn't have to can't dance all alone
you can't dance

homeboy will you please get off the floor you moron?",1
2,"yo yvette there's a lot of rumours goin' around
they're so bad baby you might have to skip town
see something's smellin' fishy and they say it's you
all i know is that you made it with the whole damn crew
they say you're a man-eater during the full moon
mascot of the senior boys' locker room
they said yvette walked in there wasn't too much rap
her reputation got bigger and so did her gap
'cause girl your momma shoulda taught you better
i'mma sit down and write you a long letter

dear yvette [x4]

i'm glad you ain't my sister then again if you was
i'd have to treat you like you was my distant 'cause
i'm not a news reporter i don't mean to assume
what should i think? i seen ya comin' out the men's bathroom
you wasn't in there alone wasn't usin' the phone
the door was locked for twenty minutes all i heard was moan

i don't really know if the story is so
i can either ask curly or larry or moe
or earl shabazz lou mookie or joe
like santa claus said you're a ho-ho-ho
in every disco you say hello
like you're a little angel but we all know
since you was eleven you been actin' this way
you always got in bed when you wanted to play
you're a freak you think you're lady godiva
some freaks are live but yvette you're liver

you're a back-seat queen a elevator pro
a high-powered body makes your levis grow
see the stories i've heard they could amaze
i heard she did it on a motorcycle back in the days
so calm down freak get a ged
that's a general education on decency
one day you'll see and agree with me
unless you're gonna be a freak until you're 93
for you there's no fee everything is free
this is from me to you not you to me
every night is your night your leather pants are tight
you try to shake your butt with all your might
i don't really wanna dis nobody
you might think i had a little too much bacardi
but that's not the problem the problem's yvette
how bad can a girl's reputation get?
see she's the kinda girl all the homeboys met
if you're desparate ask yvette 'cause she'll say bet

b-boys are hard on the boulevard
the reverend at the church said you was barred
homeboys on the block love you a lot
you're a real famous freak whether you like it or not
so before you start walking and your beak starts squawkin'
let me explain to you who is talkin'
i'm ll cool j from around the way
you boogie down to my records almost every day

for you to come inside 'cause he knew you'd stay
greg g and garfield yelled hooray",1

don't blame it on yourself sweet thing you tried
love you claimed to share just wasn't there
you're too good for that and it wasn't fair
love's taken its toll your heart he stole
you was fooled by the face of a phoney role
but i'll take up the slack support you baby
now the knight in shiny armor can only be me
i cry out your name as you hold his hand
if you're not mine soon girl my soul is damned
i'm lookin' out the window at the stormy rain
and the rush of the water makes my eyes drain
all alone in the room and it's makin' me sad
fantasize of the love we could have had
'cause i never met anyone like you before
and i can give you more

i pour wine for two even though it's just me
i tried to reach you but blind men don't see
your man is the devil but he gave you a ring
so you believe you saw an innocent angel sing
you're the type that ignores the destiny of two
it's not romeo and juliet it's me and you
you're bein handicapped by a don juan rap
you can hope i disappear girl but i'll be back
'cause i never met anyone like you before
and i can give you more
yes girl i never met anyone like you before
and i can give you more

the time has come the decision's yours
this super love story ain't workin no more
can't you understand that my love spans
higher and further than any man's
you're lookin' a gift horse right in the mouth
this time hear me out i don't care if you pout
you're my only desire i fight to the death
and i'ma scream your name when i breathe my last breath
ain't gettin' on my knees but i'm oh so close
to our love i toast all he does is boast
'cause i never met anyone like you before
and i can give you more

a knock on the door and a tap on the glass
tells me you see it my way at last
you used to reject me now you wanna kiss me
he called you up and said yo baby why you diss me?
meanwhile made romance on the sea shore
you want more of what you used to ignore
during this love affair girl it gets steamy
three nights in a row and you still wanna see me
make love at night coffee in the morn'
i be the only blanket that's keepin' you warm
'cause i never met anyone like you before
and i can give you more

i hoot in the morning to the crack of sunlight
but my agony continues till it reaches night
sweet image of your face appears on the wall
and the scene is so eerie i run through the hall
i look at the sky then i search for the moon
realize it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon
so i dress to impress exit the house
go up to the school and watch the kids come out
in the middle of the court yard there you stand
with the man who's deceiving ya holding your hand
'cause i never met anyone like you before
and i can give you more

you're the goddess of light the queen of seduction
you won't get used if you follow my instructions
your scram my hand feel the sweat on my palm
make love to a man and not a cheap don juan
and that'll be eroticism highs die down
you will find your best friend finally is found
i caress ya at night like a virgin in white
cause the new world i found is oh so tight
and tender and young soft and wet
it's hotter than any fantasy could get
'cause i never met anyone like you before
and i can give you more",1

0,"party people in the place
embrace the bass as i commence to pick up the pace
and make you motivate and accelerate
cause like tony the tiger i'm greeeat
always seem to come off hard for you somehow
i mean me being wack oh come come now
that's quite ridiculous so just admit you was
thrilled it's on your face and it's conspicuous
not that you're on this but my performance
is rather exquisite so hard is it
or supremacy that's the perfect definition
but rappers keep wishing to be in my position
know good and damn well they ain't no competition
huh i gotta give it to you kid that's ambition
for you to perpetrate the role of me the big daddy
the big father naah don't even bother
cause that would mean you would have to teach
each and every one idiotic son
trying to make it you can't fake it
the rhymes i recite are fully dressed and yours are butt naked
your speech is weak while my mine stands strong
so all hail the man that's here to live long

&ltbreak&gt

you know you heard this voice before somewhere
and when i said that i'm the kane you said oh yeah
that brother that used to rhyme on stage with biz
oh he's def you know what time it is
but this time i'm not assisted on the microphone
more like patti labelle on my own
just single-handed the mic i commanded
phony mc's don't understand it and it
is the real thing like the taste of coke
so never sleep on me better stay awoke
like a gambler in vegas i go for broke
to make a long story short yo i ain't no joke
i take time and care in whatever i'm doing
and when i rock a party i make sure that you en-
joy what you're hearing as i entertain
so hip hip hoolay long live the kane

i got the freedom of speech to use it anyway that i choose it
so all hail to the music
on exhibit get with it now here's my ring
the original supreme being black man
point blank the cream to rise supreme
as those go below like a submarine
reaching and teaching a lesson that i'm giving
addressing and impressing the crowd so how we living?
fine in mind to decline is out of line
so pardon this brother as i give you mine
to say i'm not don't even diss yourself
cause at times i have to jump back and kiss myself
long live the k the a the n the e
i say the end will be
a big movement by the time i'm through
and that's coming from a black man's point of view

now pardon me for just changing the issue
but all you sucker mc's it's a must that i diss you
the way y'all be fronting has made me disgusted
now i'mma set you straight so so yo yo bust it
rappers try and hang and just swear that they can party
but the style that i'm using is just like karate
so if we ever battle you're bound to be through
because i got a black belt in rap can do
no i'm not chinese it's just rhymes like these
that destroy an mc with black belt degrees
you're rocking a party trying so hard to get loose
kid sound awiiite but i can't taste the juice
therefore the job is left to me
so i get the party kicking just like bruce lee
but i won't stop there i still rock a little harder
while the toy mc's step and say sayonara

long live the kane x2
break it down",1
2,"let it roll get bold i just can't hold
back or fold 'cause i'm a man with soul
in control and effect so what the heck
rock the discotheques and this groove is what's next
attack react exact the mack'll move you with
a strong song as long as you groove to this
i keep the crowd loud when you're hype
do damage onstage and injure the mic
as i shoot the gift mc's stand stiff
while my rhymes stick to you like skippy and jif
feel my blood fist or my death kiss
the rap soloist you don't want none of this
supreme in this era i reign with terror
when i grab the mic believe you're gonna hear a
fascinatin' rhyme as i enchant them
so let's all sing the big daddy anthem
go with the flow my rhymes grow like an afro
i entertain again and kane'll never have no
problem i can sneeze sniffle and cough
e-e-e-even if i stutter imma still come off
'cause rappers can't understand the mics i rip
they sure enough ain't equipped that's why they got flipped
but my apparatus is up to status
don't ask who's the baddest of course that is
the maker breaker taker my rhymes ache the head
put it to bed so watch what is said
save the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone
or take a loss and be forced in the danger zone
'cause i get ill and kill at will
teachin' a skill that's real you're no thrill
so just stand still and chill as i build
science i drill until my rhymes fill
your head up don't even get up
the teacher is teachin' so just shut up

rappers take a step back or you will soon regret that
you ever had to confront me and you can bet that
i come correct perfect in full effect
disconnect dissect eject as i wreck shop
stand in command with the clan
caravan or van we go man for man and
without further ado or any delay
mister cee as we say call him the dj
mad money murf with the triple m
smooth the barber keepin' my flat-top trim
scoob lover my brother scrap lover my other
dancin' with the crew so allow the boys to smother
the floor and endure just for your pleasure
as the microphone lord proceeds to get raw
acrobatic asiatic rap fanatic
i get dramatic and rhymes start flowin' automatically
from me so don't play me obey me
when asked who's the best? you better say me
i'm sendin' sucker mc's headin' north
and if you still want some set if off
for you to cope is just a wish and a hope
and if you are what you eat they're feedin' me dope
'cause i'm just about as dope as dope can get
ultimate legit kane is a perfect fit
the king of my kingdom completin' a cipher
the lyrics i bring them keeps the crowd hyper
as i release the masterpiece
the groove will never cease until kane says peace
so maestro yo hit it
big daddy kane's about to come with it 'cause

i can't hold it back",1
3,"talk about ever meeting ms right
but one thing i know is this girl is hype
not a crab i see but such a lovely female
and if looks could kill she would be in jail
for raving all over with exotic beauty
and to captivate her love is my only duty
there's not a single feature that this girl lacks
sweetheart you're my aphrodisiac

&ltstraight r&ampb chorus&gt
you've got me waiting for you day by day
fantasies of you has got me drifting away
and i know a love like yours would be so hard to find
so i'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine

now i've talked to young girls and sophisticated ladies
but i swear my dear none appear on your level baby
maybe it's just me imagining
then again i probably just haven't been
with the right female and in detail
i'll probably never will be girl if we fail
cause every time i appear to be pleased
you know what happens?
i just get skeezed

&ltstraight r&ampb chorus&gt

the girl that i admire one that i desire
and no one can stop the feelings that you inspire
the way that you leave me in this obsession
with the chambers of my heart in your possession
we were meant to be together always and forever
for that engagement i shall endeavor
pray for the day that we combine
and i can say for sure that you're truly mine
in benevolence and reverence
as soon as our relationship commence
but for now i wait impatiently
for the day that you can give your all to me
&ltyou've got me waiting for you day by day&gt
the moment of truth is what i really should call it
i worked so hard for it so please don't spoil it
yeah it's a lot that i'm asking you to give me
that's only because i need you with me
side by side hand in hand
you as my girl and kane as your man
bust it ever since the first time that i seen her
i wanted her to step inside my arena
i'd be the champion of love wear the golden glove
and show you what a real man is made of
my feelings i'm sharing because i'm caring
my heart'll tell you why i am so endearing
for a chance at romance i would love to enhance
i would be your man under any circumstance
just as long as i can say that you're my own
your feelings for me and mine alone
we can cherish every moment of the time we spent
try to take our love to the full extent
the point that i'm trying so hard to get through
is girl i'm in love with you

&ltstraight r&ampb chorus&gt

a dramatic fanatic for our relation
cupid has me stupid with infatuation
and a fashion of passion so tenderly
with vibes i can't describe you send to me
this personal attachment in which i feel
to you my dear i will try to reveal
all over and over i'll try and try
because to see you with the next man makes me cry
i feel that i should be the only man to side you
cause no one can love you the way that i do
no one deserve the love you can give
so allow me to show you how i'm out to live
with something very special palliative and pure
and anything that you want i can give you more
i'll be calm and gentle loving and sentimental
oh so much emotion i'm talking devotion
'cause when i get involved i get involved so deep
that you would know that my love is something special to keep
but for now i guess i'll be fine
and keep waiting for the day that you'll be mine",1
4,"yo on the m-i-c right about now i go by the name of big daddy kane i got my
man scoob lover on the side of me dj mister cee on the wheels of steel dre on
the film and marley on the boards we gonna do a little something like this

big daddy
some like it hard and some like it soft
yo bust the groove as i set it off",1
5,"i'm with this
i'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat you know
and drop some smooth lyrics
'cause it's ? 8
time to set it straight know what i'm saying
and ain't no half stepping
word
i'm ready

rappers stepping to me they want to get some
but i'm the kane so yo you know the outcome
another victory
they can't get with me
so pick a bc date 'cause you're history
i'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
for you to beat me it's gonna take a miracle
and stepping to me yo that's the wrong move
so what you on hobbs dope or dog food?
competition i just devour
like a pitbull against a chihuahua
'cause when it comes to being dope hot damn
i got it good now let me tell you who i am
the b-i-g d-a-double d-y k-a-n-e
dramatic asiatic not like many
i'm different so don't compare me to another
'cause they can't hang word to the mother
at least not with the principal in this pedigree
so when i roll on you rappers you better be
ready to die because you're petty
you're just a butter knife i'm a machete
that's made by ginzu wait until when you
try to front so i can chop into
your body just because you try to be basing
friday the 13th i'mma play jason
no type of joke gag game puzzle or riddle
the name is big daddy yes big not little
so define it
here's your walking papers sign it
and take a walk
as the kane start to talk cause

ain't no half-steppin? i'm the big daddy kane

my rhymes are so dope and
the rappers be hoping
to sound like me so soon i'll have to open
a school of mcing for those who want to be in
my field in court
then again on second thought
to have mcs coming out sounding so similar
it's quite confusing for you to remember
the originator and boy do i hate a
perpetrator but i'm much greater
the best oh yes i guess suggest the rest should fess
don't mess or test your highness
unless you just address with best finesse
and bless the paragraph i manifest
rap prime minister some say sinister
non-stopping the groove until when it's the
climax and i max relax and chill
have a break from a take of me acting ill
brain cells are lit ideas start to hit
next the formation of words that fit
at the table i sit making it legit
and when my pen hits the paper ah shit
i stop and stand strong over mcs
and devour with the power of hercules
or samson but i go further the length
cause you could scalp my cameo and i'll still have strength
and no that's not a myth and if you try to riff
or get with the man with the given gift of gab
your vocab i'll only ignore
be sleeping on your rhymes till i start to snore
you can't awake me or even make me
fear you son cause you can't do me none
so think about it if you're trying to go
when you want to step to me i think you should know that

ain't no half-steppin? i'm the big daddy kane

i appear right here and scare and dare
a mere musketeer that would dare to compare
put him in the rear back there where he can't see clear
get a beer idea or near stare yeah
so on to be want to be competition
trying to step to me--must be on a mission
up on the stage is where i'mma get you at
you think i'm losing?
psst picture that

ain't no half-steppin?
mister cee step to me

the name is big daddy you know as in your father
so when you hear a def rhyme believe that i'm the author
i grab the mic and make mcs evaporate
the party people say damn that rapper's great
the creator conductor of poetry
etcetera etcetera it ain't easy being me
i speak clearly so you can understand
put words together like letter man
now that's dictation proceeding to my innovation
not like the other mcs who are an imitation
or an animation a cartoon to me
but when i'm finished i'm sure that you are soon to see
reality my secret technique
because i always speak with mentality
i put my title in your face dare you to base
and if you try and come get it yo i'mma show you who's with it
so if you know like i know instead of messing around
play like roy rogers and slooow doown
just give yourself a break or someone else will take
your title namely me 'cause i'm homicidal
that means murder 'cause i'm about to hurt a
'nother mc that try to get with me
i'll just break him and bake him and rake him
and take him and mold him and make him
hold up the peace sign

6,"&ltstaple singers oh big daddy&gt

hear ye hear ye from far and near
the one they call the big daddy kane is here
to deliver a message to everyone everywhere
so listen up party people cause this you should hear
it's a story of a far-away atmosphere
that you will find very rare and far beyond compare
all is sincere and rather debonair
so let's all gather around because

&lthmm yeah i'll take you there oh&gt x4

off to a place you thought was unreal
where people of the world do know how to chill
everything remains cool and calm where you are
and if you ask about crime they all'll say &lthah?&gt
they wouldn't even know what you mean
'cause it's a different program y'all know the routine
where people work hard for a decent buck
and you can wear truck jewelry without being stuck
never wondering whether your house is all right
so go leave your vcr on the porch overnight
and as for the people they all stand proud
senior citizens party with the hip-hop crowd
you can hang at a jam till the break of dawn
and leave without your bally shoes getting stepped on
everyone walks around in their right mind and all
because crack ain't nothing but a hole in the wall
so those who wish to live with glare and flair
there's a place that this can be done and yo

&lthmm yeah i'll take you there oh&gt x4

what i discovered may just only seem
as something that you find in your wildest dream
but on the real tip you will see
i'm not playing what i'm saying is reality
there is a place people live with joy
that the next man cannot come along and destroy
no one faces problems no one says sorry
and war ain't nothing but a game on atari
this message also applies to other nations
like africa for instance where there's starvation
but if you come with me you're sure to see
ethiopians can eat in red lobster for free
and people that you saw before that were poor
will never ever see the situation no more
cause in this world everyone's a millionaire
&ltis there wic?&gt
are you sick?
and what the hell is welfare?
fashions are smashing for all to flaunt
and we can get anything that we want
so don't think you can't afford expensive design
because fresh gucci wear is only $599
so come ye all and attend this affair
as we journey to the promised land and

&lthmm yeah i'll take you there oh&gt x3

since i'm the type of guy that laughs and jokes
this may sound funny but seriously folks
it's a shame that people today must live
in a world that's operating oh so negative
but i found a place designed especially for you
where peace and harmony is everyone's culture
so let's all gather around before this world corrupts
and we don't even need scotty to beam us up
because

&lthmm yeah i'll take you there oh&gt x4

h-h-h-hey
we gonna do a little something like this i say

i抦 the rap promoter
i start to motor
tour from new york to south dakota
drink ginger ale or root beer soda
never get the girls with the underarm order
put me on water i抦 a good floater
when i run for prez you best be a voter
once knew a girl by the name of rhoda
i watch star wars just to see yoda
or r2-d2 driving down the bq
when i buy franks i make sure they抮e hebrew
when i entertain and love to treat you
love to see a girl in a nice tight see-through
take her to the crib turn on the beta
watch a good flick by arnold schwartzenegger
maybe commando or the terminator
peace party people ha ha see you later
big daddy huh huh my man my mellow
get on the mic cause you know you eat jell-o

kane
check it out y抋ll
you don抰 stop
keep on
well it抯 the kane in the flesh
of course i抦 fresh
oh you thought that i was rotten?
huh i beg your pardon
to me getting paid and getting busy fall together
so a man of my ambiance never
could i be weak why i抦 rather unique
i got style flavor grace and plus a different technique
that i be using and not many can manage
so a brother like me i do damage
just by picking up the mic to go solo
i cold turn a party on out and oh yo
i get physical mystical very artistical
giving party people something funky to listen to
that抯 why the other mc抯 can抰 swing long
i stomp them out just like i was king kong
stepping on roaches i get ferocious
supercalifragalisticexpealidocious
i go on and on and on and
until the bright shirley murdock morning
'cause i抦ma pimp hear the primp yes the emp-
eror bringing much terror in your era
i ready willing and i抦 able so bust a move
never use a barbershop i got my homeboy smooth
cooling out with the clippers right around the way
to keep my fresh cameo cut every day
like that y抋ll it抯 like that y抋ll
it抯 like thata-the-that it抯 like that y抋ll
'cause i抦 the prosecutor taking a stand
and i抦 cross-examining you my man
the judge and jury releasing my fury
the verdict that i reach for you is rather blurry
you see the name kane is superior to many people
it means king asiatic nobody抯 equal
i hate to brag but damn i抦 good
and if mics were a gun i抎 be clint eastwood
and if rap was a game i抎 be mvp
most valuable poet on the m-i-c
or if rap was a school i抎 be the principal
aw fuck it the kane is invincible
to be specific i may die one day
but my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
it抯 a certain special skill that takes much practice
i got it good apparently you lack this
so in turn sit back and learn
listen close this is for your own concern
let me show you exactly how it抯 properly done
lights camera action
a rap pro do a show good to go also

to the man on display as i take you away

but we beat him with freedom so let抯 bless the

the cream will keep rising
we be sizing
up the asiatic one is enterprising
building and building to carry on
all the way from malcolm x to farrakhan
martin luther was a tutor many were pupils
those who fell victim were those without scruples

take a stand the fight for power

living superior abiding by nature
the history of the asiatic one paid the

like the name of antonio was gave to me

now i declare myself as the big daddy kane
the teacher teaching a lesson to be heard
that抯 word to the mother my brother

then i drop the beat i have in store
lay dynamics on the top like a rug
make it sound smooth and later make a dub
an mc ate well so that you can tell
i am not illiterate no not even a little bit
nothing like an idiot get it?
you want the record cool i'm with it
let the rhythm take you shake it cause it makes you
as i turn the knob of the door you escape through
go in like a knot don't be a puff
and i let it play cause dre's getting funky enough

it's getting funky it's getting funky repeat 3x
watch the smooth lyrics that take place

if you want another reason why it must be funky
yo i am not a jackass meaning not a donkey
so i will play the game like it should be played
drop the funk into the mix so the place will never fade
ship it ship it to the stations in your jurisdiction
others say i'm dope and the others think i'm bitching
no crowd can avoid the d-o to the c
when i'm p-e-r-f-o-r-m-i-n-g
on the stage see the simple fact is i engulf
and known i rock a funky beat without a cord so
it is my conclusion you will enjoy the fusion
and i will ascend with the style i am using
knowing that it's tough and it's not a bluff
i think i'll let it play cause dre's hitting funky enough

it's getting funky it's getting funky repeat 3x
dre make the funky hip-hop music so check it

listen to the kick drop in with the click
and with no rehearses i'm dropping funky verses
stupid with the bit that you think you are relying on
you love it when it rattles is the fact that i'm buying on
suckers never come close cause of knowing
there is no stopping the doc when i'm flowing
but in the event that someone will try and juice this
stop him in his tracks show him that i am ruthless
i don't give a damn don't think that i am joking
'cause i don't think it is funny when you're messing with my money
instinct would tell me this yo dre you gotta stop him
but with no frills so i just drop him
continue with the rhyme and make sure i get mine
with no static 'cause i sold an sng to get my nine but
lessons have been learned now all kidding have been fronting
let it play when the people say dre yo you're getting funky enough

it's getting funky it's getting funky repeat 3x
deal with the d-o to the c

i need a break so i can check around
see who the hell that is sitting down
i want all chairs off the floor
and if he stands to the wall show him the door
and the pk nothing giving you something to rock to
to go nonstop to not have to look at the clock you
percieve but can't believe you're being taken
by a beat so cool you start shaking
and shivering 'cause i'm delivering the answer
haven't seen you're a hellified dancer
you tried sitting but it just won't work
cause the beat is to rough
don't even tell it won't be funky enough

it's getting funky it's getting funky repeat 3x
and with the help of the dr dre kick it

it's getting funky on the mix now right repeat 4x
put it in the needle and drop it on the one boy",1
1,"this is serious business y'all ready to get hyped or what?
well right about now the doc and the doctor is housing
the set center stage pumping it just like this

a little something for the breatheren with intellect you truly understand
it's like a message from the one who's getting candid
making a mark on the strength with rhyming like nothing
when you're pumping something that's bumping
did it 'cause it's like i had to make one
better than the last one cause a mistake none
but something new was needed in the mix to
make it as lethal so lethal that i would think you
couldn't be made to invade certain areas
no other jurisdiction but that was fiction
as you progress and you're enlightened
and the better you're writing by never biting you're reciting
to the crowd club congregation or gathering
homies in the street will be thinking you're og
smooth wordy example of how i'm living
i'm getting my prime pumping records that'll blow your mind

the doc is dope i would've been down with rock but i'd be broke
by the punk i'm opening up my trunk
to reveal debt living it up my life is like a story
yelling it cause nobody else is telling it
checking it always getting paid cause the rap is sort of like a twist
between what you needed and what i mean
what i mean by twist now you gotta listen
never a song executive 'cause i'm a part of what you've been missing
so in total this is one of many styles of an artist
hard it may be but not my hardest
just a portion cup of salt water in the ocean
rocking it was the notion it seems i needed a potion
so i asked the dr d-r-e could he comply
looking at me with a grin he shrugged his head and said why
would you ask me a question knowing you knew the answer?
all the time i make the records you can hear it and blow their mind

the doc is looking for a dope beat to lay in something melodic
after 30 seconds dre looked up and said i got it
like the dope sound rolling with the dope beat made me rock a dope rhyme
which was simple 'cause i'm
equivalent to the greatest nobody know before
'cause i just decided to make myself apparent once more
to deliver to you in order just call it a system
a brother tried to play me like a kid so i dismissed him
and now i'm ruthless by keeping the crowd grooving
it gets so rowdy that you swear your chair's moving
but it wouldn't it couldn't it's more a feeling you encounter
when you're rocking to the music of the doc and
dre is on the cut so be wary of all moving
but whatever you do take the time
to enhance the record by making moves like smooth
and i'll keep pumping lyrics type of music that'll blow your mind",1
2,"a little bit better than dopest
a brand new kid in showbiz
with knowledge i persevere
but now do me a favor lend me an ear

and we can find the rhyme to fill in space
and drop the bass with a taste of light
lyrical perfection see i'm equipped to um
open your mind like a christmas gift
it's '89 the new school is needed
originals see nobody can do it like we did
the d-o to the c-o a deuce not a trio
me-o mi-o spin a chump like a gyro
hard dangerous suckers angle this
cut is raw why? 'cause they can't handle this
loot to bring and i take a second to rock the rhythm
and stay smooth like a prism
a portrait of a masterpiece it's funky enough
cause dre told me it has to be
a little stronger to i make not a mistake
i'm too much on the hype tip dre break

circle an answer it's a multiple choice
who's the kid with the golden voice?
a the brother upon this song
b and c i don't know but that answer's wrong
pure simplicity it's the d-o to the c
most incredible unforgettable
on a mission the man kids want to be
like that 'cause i'm one in a mil
hype producer creator maker
making it now but i'll do it for you later
in the mix dre put his hands on
scratching now that's a hell of a song
i show and tell what should be told
and say it with conviction and proper use of diction
so that it's easy to understand
who can do it better? huh no one can
'88 is gone and all you big shots
have graduated in other words made it
so it's a new year to start a new time
you need to know what's on my mind so lend me an ear

hold the riff sucker 'cause we don't need that
it's so don't standing and my mic don't feed back
break you're broke he got up and forgot
i drop science and put his neck in a knot
trying to hold what can't be held
so the punk records jam i don't give a damn
i do it in a different class so what's up?
you wanna break? you're all the threat of a buttercup
as knowledge coming i'm coming never sleep or slip
i fall on the serious tip
stop and stutter trying to think your brain is soft
words are clogged in your throat you're coughing on
the boss straight from the south
word is bond from word of mouth
so let the nation be hip to the fact that i'm the great one
until i sung no damage done
peace a dream we all dream together
dope forever together in a nation of one
rising and showing no fear
yo lend me a motherfucking ear",1
4,"together we witness one of the most delightful in our times
so um let the bass go

nah it's got to go a little lower than that dre drop it
nah it's gotta go even lower than that you know why? why?

you've been denied although you've tried
so i've been a ving to make you fall like a tide
no disappointment cause my beat will sooth like an ointment
suckers with static approach and get rolled and smoked like a joint
phlegm ignites the flame i mean i burn like a lighter
roll with the hip-hop groove 'cause i'm a writer
the hero of great take a stand and we'll see
eat in chronological order starting with me
a rap introduction the suckers destruction
yeah are all involved when i started conducting
the lyrics are the maximum i stated for facts in them
chumps never try to break knowing i'd wax them
murder in the first degree
occurs only when dealing with the d-o to the c
i'm like a whirlwind pyramid and i'm letting you know
i get ill when i hear the bass go

yeah that's the sound and you know it's down
but you know why? why's that?

'cause i've been around and you've heard the sound
of the doc and the new style that i've found
it's quite unorthodox but still bass and
enough to make you dance so i picked up the pace and
let it ride like a cyclist
and see it show in the end that i'm the mightiest
and i'm lyrically inclined to make you want to step to my time
the beat and the cut to this rhyme
do a show and i'm good to like a g-o
never getting skeezed i mean it's like an n-o
happiness to me is like a positive cash flow
so i let your ear cold hear when the bass go

drop that bass aight bet

i don't wanna stop 'cause if i do you might lose it
i made this record for you to jam so use it
kill the treble pump the bass and then
send the suckers on the block into a tailspin
roll by booming like a nuke bomb
i know there's pressure on your ears but stay calm
after you pass though you better turn it down some
or else you're gonna put a dent into your eardrum
success realize on the individual
i feel successful when receiving the residual
but as for you you all should know
when i say let's get hype i'm letting the bass go

now that's the way it should be done
i know that's on the one and that is fun

to see a sucker standing weary
and girlies on the tip standing near me
the bass was the topic so i dropped it
added some dop lyrics and then i dropped it
on track 24 in a machine
to make you move on the hip-hop scene
cued up dre and i knew that he would know
that on the one i would let the bass go
because a dope jam is what i gotta make
i make it rattle cause you love it when it vibrates
the d-o and to the c
must cause pleasure when showing yo my abilities
to inject on the set mass enjoyment
this is to insure definite employment
when i hit town yo you'll know
crowds will roar and you'll hear the bass go

yeah let the bass go
this is most definitely down with my homeboy dj speed is that on track?
word 'em up peace",1
5,"ayo stan dre laid the tracks i'm laying the vocals
we need some guitar that rocks know what i'm saying?
so um let's do this

she's a rich girl but not the ordinary
extraordinary a little too much to carry
possessed by a demon on a mission
no man alive can refuse her proposition
&gtfrom this fantasy but to me she was more than
a bad dream she was a nightmare for man
took her sex appeal and she taunted
twisted the brother until he did just what she wanted
direguard the laws of the other man
sacrificing the plight of the brother man
i'm not the type to let a woman make me weary
but to resist he'd have to be a fairy
nothing that a brother wouldn't want to indulge in
drives a porche and her purse is bulging
her body in the form of a romantic medly
but be warned she's beautiful but deadly

she's all about the bank roll you can tell by the gold
eyes deep enough to engulf your soul
she's like medusa but you won't turn to stone if you watch her
one fatal look is all it takes and she's got ya
on your knees and no more to spend
and you're still thinking how you want to see her again
it'll be difficult but boy it ain't no joke
saying nothing going on but her rent and a car note
you're wondering how in the hell
little knowing you're the reason that she lives so well
guessing so hard you'll submerge her attraction
but she go so many son you're a subtraction
now you roll like you're crazy
attitude is send down with being spacy
never will i let this stupid bitch get ahead of me
i know the scoop the bitch is beautiful but deadly

she'll keep you mystified like a swami
for you to slow her down you'll need an army
of a thousand strong brothers with a gun
but if they're careless then they're done
she's an animal not to be taken lightly
once she has a grip and squeezes tightly
you're in line for such a wonderful kiss
it'll cloud your site like the morning mist
no compassion the minute after you're a slave
breaking the law making sure she's paid
yo you oughta know the girl you see at every concert
she's in the back with the tightest dress looking the best
know what i'm saying? you have to do like my man cube
tell the females that i ain't the one
'cause if you don't readily you're back doing it readily
it's all to keep up the pace with someone beautiful but deadly",1
7,"this is to listen to so ask not a question
not to be taken as a simple suggestion
but a warning to whom it may concern
if knowledge is the key then i think it's time you learn
for there is not the problem
so leaders are acknowledged i don't follow them
i turn into another degree
and find the d-o to the c and growing like a tree and
causing much destruction 'cause i'm crushing
complimented much yeah but never blushing
hard like a criminal and i'm subliminal
in my own right i'm dope 'cause it's original
funky unmistakibly so
when the vocals are done then you know
it's all a matter of setting a date
for america's most complete artist but wait
make sure that you keep the facts in mind
don't mess with the great cause the doc is like a nine
with a voice telling you the bullet's direction
i'm talking murder but that's another section
i need to explain by keeping my composure
there's no jerking a sucker when he knows your
nothing but a villain and you'll kill him
so he's in fear but there ain't no need in spilling
your guts to a nut no i am not your equal
meaning your equivalent i'm all like heaven sent
i got it together so clever no one could sever
remember this forever

no one can do it better repeat 3x

knowledge is the key and hard work is the fee
for me to be the great at the start and remain to be
a threat till the opposition is warned
as long as a song 'cause i was born
with instincts to kill a grave mentality
over the edge and you say you want to battle me?
at your own risk approach and be hosted
and in the end you may win or be roasted
but seeing that it's part of a game you think if you hang
close to the one and you'll claim but that's lame
and i'm damn another loser
without an apology so next time i'm a use a
little more force to get the message across
it's the doc on the boss
creating demonstrate some realate to easy listening
but here's a christening of what you've been missing
an exhibition a hip-hop introduction
smooth lyrical gab and i do the conducting
drop it on a rhytm suckers face it
but new to the masses it's like i'm starting classes
better bet i understand the direction
that i'm going in fact when i'm flowing
the news is a constant change from one minute to the next
i'm different 'cause i always show flex
and it's essential that's why i got it together
to the letter and

no one can do it better repeat 3x

i need to make it understood the doc is not a hood
not at all even though i carry a weapon when i'm stepping
i'm not a murderer not in the sense that you're a customer
i buy in the system with suckers smoothly bust them
opposition is taken and that's a quote from the doc
and the doctor cause this ain't no joke
so if you smile here's the outcome
your teeth are gone your mouth is numb
don't get involved unless you're willing
to risk murder by mic when they're illing
you gotta be weary watch for caution yo be warned
by dre and out the project born
capable in any and every
cause yo i get heavy when introduced to a medly
such is the case before the bass started womping
i had to hook it up with the boys from compton
searched and found the sound and accepted
the job of making la well respected
of course with the help of the gang that's ruthless
peace to the homies as i do what i mean and
mc ren is in the house ice cube is definitely in the house
dj yella teach yella cold with the hoes
and eazy e is stupid chilling 'cause he knows yo
no matter who's badder i'll be the dopest forever
by kicking lyrics so clever that

no one can do it better repeat 5x

time is dedicated to say peace to the homeboys
my homie laylaw mc ren ice cube eazy e
dj yella fresh k mc smooth my homie t-low
and of course without a doubt the one and only
my dj dr d-r-e most definitely in the house
peace to those homies and i'm outta here",1
8,"the said it was all about knowledge
and know i feel like i got most of it all
dre drop it

parental discrestion is advised when the doc gets candid
to move like a one-armed bandit
arrange the tempo when i go solo
the beat and the cut to a rhyme and it's oh so
raw cause you want to jam then you go damn he's good
and you're right 'cause i am
and i'm strong strong enough to reach them
they said they wanna learn so i'm a teach them
amplified by a microphone my point it known
so yo leave the pad at home
i'm down with the sound so much that i can feel it
if there's a deal to be dealt then i'll deal it
i'm on a roll that's word to the father
chumps want to break but i tell 'em i don't bother
char the memory of all who saw the
last of the concerned i burn like lava
so in sum you break you broke it
and i'm smiling but not joking
secrets are told fold but never did
with the knowledge as strong as a whirlwind pyramid

it was mandatory a righteous editorial
cause my sport is like part of a memorial
knowing the whole i was told through a pole
i have the juice to make vinyl gold
servent at your service never nervous
why am i claiming the great? 'cause i deserve this
title is vital i receive directly
so i don't have to deal with suckers trying to check
t-r to the a-y do they have to be warned? just try
and i'll start crushing without discussion
checking the crowd with the rhymes i'm busting
cool a quality i have to mention
gaining with the dope comprehension
i move the corwd so i make it my bid
pop the lid yeah see a whirlwind pyramid

hold it you're a step off the pace so catch up
and if you're sitting get your black ass up
dance to the rhythm let it move your pants
and if you don't dance i assume you can't
and as the crowd steadily expanding
so move 'cause i don't want to see you standing
you're in the way so hey you gotta step
left right i don't give a damn just jet
as you leave the party in the light you can see body
everybody but you're a toasting maseratti
cause you don't want to handle the scandal
physical abuse 'cause you're as drunk as tony randall
and it's a gamble i mean i've heard you ramble
on and on but you get worn like a sandal
they said get raw and i did then i slid to the back
and hid behind a whirlwind pyramid

the d-o to the c with some help from my boy t-e-e
is now operating smoothly
original knowledge of the whirlwind pyramid
big dollars i'm gonna always clock
and i'm always down to rock

i had some gin and sacco i think you're drunk
now i'm ready to rock-o hah hah",1
10,"high energy flowin' with the wisdom
sense of a rich man knowledge and the rhythm
this is what i'm using to come up with a style
so i'll interact altogether better with the crowd
nervous for a second then the record starts spinnin'
and i fall into the state of mind of what i'd just created
pump it like the dr d into the re suckers ready to leap
up on the tip when we made it
creative so i'll never be regarded as a regular
more than just a little bit better than my competitor
you should never underestimate the fashion
i hold for the stage whether i'm coolin' or thrashin'
clockin' the concoction created by me
when read you read e equals the do to the c
knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
equals an artist that wont' be worn what is that dre?
it's the formula

it's like a message that only i could understand
but those who want to comprehend will again
be in the midst of the brother unlike another in any way
'cause dre don't play say what the other say
originality is a must whenever i bust
a funky composition it's crush and i trust that you
know it when you hear a funky record with potential
me gettin' hype 'cause dre rockin' the instrumental
nothing like what you've heard before and more never less
see i don't fess i mean i'm like fresh if not the freshest
when i'm expressin' my thoughts on
vinyl you can't help but listen up and get caught on
hooked because i cook when i pick up a pen
and begin in the end it's dope that's 'cause i want to win
knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
equals the doc what is it dre?
yo man that's the formula

keepin' it dope as long as i can like imagine
makin' each record that i do better than the last one
take a little time choose the topic and drop it
release it the science of makin' dope beats with
rhythmic american poetry
shipped it to stations now many people know of me
i'm the d into the o and the o into the c and the c into the period
suckers are fearing' this
when heard the dope style calculated by the great wait
and take just a second to get caught up in my record
new but not a kid to be worn
if something' gettin' torn up then i'm doin' the tearin' not bein' torn
shapin up to be one for the top vocalist lyricist
and when you hear of this you shouldn't choke on this
knowledge and the talent makes it valid
for me to get it patented dre tellin' what i'm rappin'
the formula

in effect and i'm smooth that's why i'm on the incline
suckers frontin' for nothin' 'cause i'm goin' to get mine
it's in the cards and i thank i might have read this
so don't lie and try to front like someone said this
most who know thoughts served by the doc see
that it's a mission impossible tryin' to rock me
for an arena who'd ask me to perform for her
go and easily i flow and ya know usin' the formula",1
11,"yeah c'mon
c'mon yeah c'mon

let's take a trip but not of the physical
sense of direction on a kid who's artistical
through a gallery of thoughts of course it's dope
pay it tough like the name on my rope
watch it be weary instead of steppin wit the boys
a musical massacre of inadequate noise
by the new authority 'cause of majority
of peers who hear will award superiority
to those who know you knew now it's inevitable
i laid the track and it's simple unforgettable
time had hold me better than gold i sold
and in front of a group of soul is a new episode
so like see if you can grab a pawn yet another one
take it to the everyday like it's done the son
words connected up to another degree
and if an artist who planned it there portrait of a masterpiece
it's unquestionable
the lyrics used the doc's a professional
nothing exquisite to prohibit you from listening up
crisp and clean but i don't mean 7-up
i preside ill dippy dope to frantic to panic
and just a man on a mission wit something more in the attic
i'm just an ordinary faring very few
do it to the mic is the do to the c you
made the choice that doesn't need to pretend
i'm on the extend i know about the ?elevator end?
but anytime between i'm spinning
play strong write it like it never ending
keep creating while suckers are hating me now
keep the upper hand 'cause the respond is gonna plow
no one can handle the physical torture
i've been taking and no matter what i'll support'cha
goals and dreams although is seems it won't come true
all of that is up to you yo
but if you can't handle
you need a check 'cause rap's like a gamble
basically outspoken keeping them choking on
but you recall yo a helluva rap song
doing it forever together wit dre it will never cease
plenty of records like portrait of a masterpiece
not an exceptionalist
sort of the norm walking and holding my testicles
?swoon for a six? spell out what it means to be dope
the do to the c they can't cope
deal the real yo it's better 'cause i had to be
better than any 'cause of majority
negative never i'm all about a positive force if you recall
it's the doc on the ball
rap much greater dre upon the fader
pump the bass and the pace
most like by the doc and this is it
'cause when it's hype then i feel that it's the shit
word never would i stop i drop the beat i will
especialy when i have to kill
i'm an annihilator standing a full 6' 3
and i really don't think you wanna deal wit me
potrait of a watch out i'll go

doc hold on dre stop the beat let me catch my breath
dre aiyyo man why ya stopping that was funky
doc to catch my breath
dre all right you got it yeah kick it

strong blowing kisses to the wind
the doc in fact to attack the wicky wack
and take the rightful place at a rightful time
the do to the c and it's mine
move 'cause no one's gonna take my spot
doing the groove why 'cause it's the diggy diggy doc

dre yeah that's cool let's go to the next record",1
12,"dr dre
check this out we've come to the last and final record
this is dr dre in full effect and we gonna kick it off a little some this like this
we got my mella yella boy on the drums we got stan the guitar man
dropping the rhythm we got la dre on the keyboard and i want the whole
posse in this motherfucker to rock on this funky ass beat we're gonna drop
all right so ice cube you the early bird on this motherfucker run it

ice cube
picture a nigga that's raw
amplify his ass and what you see is what's on
motherfuckers i slaughter blow 'em out the water
word to me fuck the father
my melody is deadly as a pin in a hand grenade
5 seconds before you get played
you can't throw me i guess you'll blow up
ever see a sucker scatter it'll make ya throw up
then i take advantage you can't manage
to get up all you can do is sit up i get lit up
hit up ice cube tearing shit up
like a dude you can bet on
collide like a head on
collision stutter stepping is an incision
of a nigga saying exactly what i vision
because i'm gone you think i left you all
but i stay in yo' ass like cholesterol
when i blast some solid ass alcatraz
and if you escape you better swim fast
'cause i'll catch ya physically and mentally
and the capital punishment's the penalty
sitting in the electric chair grab a hold
pull the switch yo' body twitch your eye's explode
out your skull 'cause being dull on a flow
is an n-o niggas didn't know that i can go
off and show off to throw off the law
turn take 10 paces then draw
what's left is a motherfucker dead in the alley
ice cube is the shit on the grand finale

dr dre
yeah yeah that was funky but we need the motherfucking villain to speak
so kick it

mc ren
the grand finale yo it's my turn to bust
so let weak motherfuckers turn to dust
if you're weak it ain't my fault
just take a kick in the ass and get turn into a pillar of salt
and niggas that's biting just to taste me
i make the punk motherfuckers buckle up for safety
and on the dope they caught from the flash
and swing like a bit when he's caught in a whiplash
giving him pain 'cause i'm urgent
rearrange the motherfucking face like a surgeon
it ain't no excuse for the torture delivering
don't say that i scare you i can tell 'cause your shivering

i say fuck the police yo so now they after me
i'm wanted by the law so i stay low
representing the pimp bitches making my dough
in a different stage i must of went on a rampage
me and the doc are always hitting the front page
for what for stealing and stepping up to the sheriff
and when i enter the party niggas shit in a cell pimp
for what maybe 'cause i'm ren
and when they clean up shit yo they do it again
so fuck it sit back cool and relax
while eazy busts the facts kicking the grande finale

dr dre
yeah y'all know what time it is easy motherfucking e is in the house doing
damage

eazy e
the name is eazy for me to come off like the inforcer'
mass murder motherfuckers in a course of
an everyday situation where i would stalk by
fuck the car i do a motherfucking walk-by
eazy-e and the do to the c and
run house and there won't be no disagreeing
'cause if there is some you feeling staticy
then i'm arrested for what assault and battery
never outdone only outdoing
loving the bitches and the hoes boo hooing
why 'cause they're addicted to my dick
the pleasure of pain the wing-ding and flipped it
yeah and never forget when done in bed by
eazy the name of a compton hard head
cool but local like loc never broke
'cause they're paid to be ruthless this is why i do this
i don't give a fuck about fame
i rather deal wit a number than a motherfucking name word
get me paid and then rap
'cause all the other bullshit money ain't jack
eazy but not that eazy to deal wit
especially if you're popping bullshit
put the e-a-z-y and to the e
expression of thought on the motherfucking grand finale

dr dre
yeah that shit was funky last but not least is the motherfucking doc
this is your album so that means you definitely got to get funky so run it

the doc
swinging singing a brand new rap
on a rhythm concocted by my homie in the back and
if it makes you giggle it must be kinda funny
but to me it's kinda cool tell 'em why i'm making money
tripping up the man wit the swig tan movement
proving if you're grooving then it cool when he be doing it
taking a second for me to blow your mind
'cause i'm the diggy diggy doc and i would've been down wit rock
but i was smart the do to the c now on the formula
it's rough i mean it's funky enough for me
and you can have a listen after that and this and
d-o-n-'t m-o-v-e wit out permission
from the do to the c i'm just better than
the normal man and i'll be dumb if a sucker can
ever compete wit the elite
much less beat it's like dancing wit 2 left feet
never smile when the doc is in the room
or i'm a send ya ass to the temple of doom
i got raw when i came to cali

this is a lesson if ya guessin and if ya borrowin
hurry hurry step right up and keep followin
the leader

verse two

this is a lifetime mission vision of prison
aight listen
in this journey you're the journal i'm the journalist
am i eternal? or an eternalist?
i'm about to flow long as i can possibly go
keep ya movin cause the crowd said so
dance - cuts rip ya pants
eric b on the blades bleedin to death - call the ambulance
pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
a magnum as a microphone murderin' mc's
let's quote a rhyme from a record i wrote
follow the leader yeah - dope
cause every time i stop it seems ya stuck
soon as ya try to step off ya self-destruct
i came to overcome before i'm gone
by showin and provin and lettin knowledge be born
then after that i'll live forever - you disagree?
you say never? then follow me
from century to century you'll remember me
in history - not a mystery or a memory
god by nature mind raised in asia
since you was tricked i have to raise ya
from the cradle to the grave
but remember - you're not a slave
'cause we was put here to be much more than that
but we couldn't see it because our mind was trapped
but i'm here to break away the chains take away the pains
remake the brains reveal my name
i guess nobody told you a little knowledge is dangerous
it can't be mixed diluted it can't be changed or switched
here's a lesson if ya guessing and borrowing
hurry hurry step right up and keep following
the leader

verse three

a furified freestyle lyrics of fury
my third eye makes me shine like jewelry
you're just a rent-a-rapper your rhymes are minute-maid
i'll be here when it fade to watch you flip like a renegade
i can't wait to break and eliminate
on every traitor or snake - so stay awake
and follow and follow because the tempo's a trail
the stage is a cage the mic is a third rail
i'm rakim the fiend of a microphone
i'm not him so leave my mic alone
soon as the beat is felt i'm ready to go
so fasten your seatbelt 'cause i'm about to flow
no need to speed slow down to let the leader lead
word to daddy indeed
the r's a rollin' stone so i'm rollin'
directions is told then the rhymes are stolen
stop buggin' a brother said dig em i never dug 'em
he couldn't follow the leader long enough so i drug 'em
into danger zone he should arrange his own
face it it's basic erase it change ya tone
there's one r in the alphabet
it's a one-letter word and it's about to get
more complex from one rhyme to the next
eric b be easy on the flex
i've been from state to state followers tailgate
keep comin' but you came too late but i'll wait
so back up regroup get a grip come equipped
you're the next contestant - clap ya hands you won a trip
the price is right - don't make a deal too soon
how many notes could you name this tune?
follow the leader is the title theme task
now ya know you don't have to ask
rap is rhythm and poetry cuts create sound effects
you might catch up if you follow the records e wrecks
until then keep eatin and swallowin
you better take a deep breath and keep followin
the leader",1
1,"i was a fiend before i became a teen
i melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
fitted like pieces of puzzles complicated
'cause i grabbed the mic and try to say yes y'all
they tried to take it and say that i'm too small
cool 'cause i don't get upset
i kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug then i jet
back to the lab without a mic to grab
so then i add all the rhymes i had
one after the other one then i make another one
to dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done
i get a craving like i fiend for nicotine
but i don't need a cigarette know what i mean?
i'm raging ripping up the stage and
don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
thought of 'cause it's sort of an addiction
magnatized by the mixing
vocals vocabulary your verses you're stuck in
the mic is a drano volcanoes erupting
rhymes overflowing gradually growing
everything is written in the cold so it can coin-
cide my thoughts to guide
48 tracks to slide
the invincible microphone fiend rakim
spread the word 'cause i'm in
e-f-f-e-c-t
a smooth operator operating correctly
but back to the problem i gotta habit
you can't solve it silly rabbit
the prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
i fiend for a microphone like heroin
soon as the bass kicks i need a fix
gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
and i'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
unawareness? beware it's the re-animator
a menace to a microphone a lethal weapon
an assassinater if the people ain't stepping
you see a part of me that you never seen
when i'm fiending for a microphone i'm the microphone fiend

after 12 i'm worse that a gremlin
feed me hip-hop and i start trembling
the thrill of suspense is intense your horrified
but this ain't the cinemas of tales from the darkside
by any means necessary this is what has to be done
make way 'cause here i come
my dj cuts material
grand imperial
it's a must that i bust any mic you're hand to me
it's inherited it's runs in the family
i wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back
if that don't slow 'em up i carry a full pack
now i don't want to have to let off you should of kept off
you didn't keep the stage warm -- step off
ladies and gentleman you're about to see
a pastime hobby about to be
take it to the maximum i can't relax see i'm
hype as a hyperchrondriac 'cause the rap be one-
hell of a antidote something you can't smoke
more than dope you're trying to move away but you can't you're broke
more than cracked up you should have backed up
for those who act up need to be more than smacked up
any entertainer i got a torture chamber
one on one and i'm the remainder
so close your eyes and hold your breath
and i'm a hit'cha wit the blow of death
before you go you'll remember you seen
the fiend of a microphone i'm the microphone fiend

the microphone fiend",1
2,"verse one

i'm rated rthis is a warning ya better void
poets are paranoid dj's d-stroyed
'cause i came back to attack others in spite-
strike like lightnin' it's quite frightenin'
but don't be afraid in the dark in a park
not a scream or a cry or a bark more like a spark
ya tremble like a alcoholic muscles tighten up
what's that lighten up you see a sight but
suddenly you feel like you're in a horror flick
you grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quick
music's the clue when i come your warned
apocolypse now when i'm done ya gone
haven't you ever heard of a mc-murderer?
this is the death penalty and i'm servin' a
death wish so come on step to this
hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist
friday the thirteenth walking down elm street
you come in my realm ya get beat
this is off limits so your visions are blurry
all ya see is the meters at a volume
pumping lyrics of fury

it's a fearified freestyle

terror in the styles never error-files
indeed i'm known-your exiled
for those that oppose to be level or next to this
i ain't a devil and this ain't the exorcist
worse than a nightmare you don't have to sleep a wink
the pain's a migraine every time ya think
flashbacks interfere ya start to hear
the r-a-k-i-m in your ear
then the beat is hysterical
that makes eric go get a ax and chops the wack
soon the lyrical format is superior
faces of death remain
mc's decaying 'cause they never stayed
the scene of a crime every night at the show
the fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know
it's only one capable breaks-the unbreakable
melodies-unmakable pattern-unecscapable
a horn if want the style i posses
i bless the child the earth the gods and bomb the rest
for those that envy a mc it can be
hazardous to your health so be friendly
a matter of life and death just like a ethch-a-sketch
shake till your clear make it disappear make the next
after the ceremony let the rhyme rest in peace
if not my soul'll release
the scene is recreated reincarnated updated i'm glad you made it
'cause your about to see a disastrous sight
a performance never again performed on a mic
lyrics of fury

a fearified freestyle

the r is in the house-too much tension
make sure the system's loud when i mention
phrases that's fearsome
you want to hear some sounds that not only pounds but please your eardrums
i sit back and observe the whole scenery
then nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me
strictly business i'm quickly in this mood
and i don't care if the whole crowd's a witness
i'm a tear you apart but i'm a spare you a heart
program into the speed of the rhyme prepare to start
rhythm's out of the radius insane as the craziest
musical madness mc ever made see it's
now an emergency open-heart surgery
open your mind you will find every word'll be
furier than ever i remain the furture
battle's tempting whatever suits ya
for words the sentence there's no resemblance
you think you're ruffer then suffer the consequences
i'm never dying-terrifying results
i wake ya with hundreds of thousands of volts
mic-to-mouth resuscitation rhythm with radiation
novicane ease the pain it might save him
if not eric b's the judge the crowd's the jury
how do i plead to homicide?

verse one rakim

this is for thousands of people who came
a show from road to road you're entertained
i don't even have to say my name
'cause when the place is ripped in half i'm to blame
masses of posses packed up schemin
ladies lovely and keep on screamin
go rakim go rakim go
it won't be long then it's on with the show
i'm late so hit the brakes and park the benzito
double oh seven incognito
sneak in the back door lookin' for the stage
when i get on you react in a rage
people from side to side and front to back
won't dance if the mc's wack
the crowd go psycho even if i don't move
some like the groove 'cause i'm so smooth
then somethin' happens feet start tappin
you can't hold back when rakim's rappin'
the man you've been waitin for rougher than ever
ladies and gentlemen put your hands together

eric b clap your hands cut and scratched 8x
rakim clap your hands

verse two rakim

i create em take em shake em then make 'em clap to this
most of you rappers can't even rap to this
i made it faster you tried to master
syncopated styles words flowin after
measures of metaphor definitions of more than one
take it both ways i'll be here when you're done
remember as the rhyme goes on it's rougher
soon as i stop you had enough of
followin footsteps you better turn back soon
sucker mc's suck rhymes like vacuums
the style remains the same the words is changed
bitten rewritten recited and rearranged
sing along if your tongue is strong it gets sore
sing when i'm gone and it'll break your jaw
wisdom flows so swift i'm asiatic
is it a gift or automatic
static i don't cling
i got a tip of my own and i don't sing
don't understand here's an example
and why mc's and dj's sample
'cause we don't have a band it's just my voice and his hands
that's what hip-hop was it still stands
the records we use are from mom's and pop's collection
find a break from a dope selection
and go to the store then buy one more
so my dj can mix cause that's what his hands are for
years later hip-hop got contracts
the chance to put actual facts on wax
a mind's the coach the physical form's the team
the top's the destination i'm the cream
and still i rise with somethin' pumpin and somethin' clever
ladies and gentlemen put your hands together

eric b clap your hands cut and scratched 7x
rakim clap your hands clap em clap em

verse three rakim

now who's the man with the masterplan?
with stacks of verbal attacks so clap your hands
rhyme written in graffiti xeroxed on blueprints
students influenced are now a nuisance
you couldn't fight it you had to clap to this
you got excited you almost snapped your wrist
the rhymes was written for the crowd's enjoyment
when i'm with this you can't toy with
the def jam juicer rough rhyme producer
loads of lyrics get you loose then looser
the man so smooth and world so rough
eric is throwin' and sewin rippin restitchin the cuts
microphone your majesty no one's bad as me
seems the tragedy rakim had to be
thinkin' of some def view of a video
visions are vicious and i'll let the city know
whoever's frontin they know nothin' to say though
so lay low musical forms are kickin' like kato
don't get near it hard as you ever hear it
i know it's fearified but don't fear it
and try to predict which rhyme you can kick
you're quick to pick your best for the mic is lit
instead of goin' with the flow like you're supposed to go
and enjoy the show and yo put your hands together

it's to the listeners for those that have a ear for this
state of the art engineered for the mix
eardrums are playing along to what i'm sayin' you're singin' a song
stevie blass on the keyboard swingin' along
but you don't have to dance play it cool and listen
my dj's mixin and i'll do the quizzin
cause who is number one if not best then better
here's a hint the 18th letter
the rhymes is sportable microphone is portable
for any immortal man swords is not affordable
never take a loss 'cause i'm hard to beat
i ain't cheap but don't sell me a dream i don't sleep
i'm paid in full so save the bull
this ain't a stick-up you don't have to wave until
you feel sure and you want more then wipe your sweat
'cause i just wanted to see how hype you could get
'cause when i came in the door steppin hard enough to shake the floor
i just started but the others can't make no more
runnin' out of beats breaks and out of time
if i was gone you'd be runnin' out of rhymes
i improve record don't have to be long
if it's understood and the story is strong
you can speak out and hold the crowd as prisoners
the people is peepless it's to the listeners

verse two

i'm the lord for somethin' you can absorb
try and control and be cautious but the cut's in a cord
make me deeper than down i make the crowd crowd around
people are peepless cause the soloist found
phrases thoughts made by the r of course
one thing i do is keep 'em different and far from yours
you keep talkin' when will all the damage be done?
you say you're rulin but when i'm in the place you don't come
maybe you're waitin to see what i'm makin'
one more style gets taken then i'ma be breakin
if the patterns are causes piano is soft
but make it hard for you to start where i left off
you find yourself till the point is across
you hit reverse to rewind it that's when you hit the pause
i set the scene first you hear mixin
then the microphone fiend's in effect still listenin?
pay close attention never before mentioned
listen up i got a brand new invention
made from a musician it's notes are played crisp
but listeners listen to what i wrote on a disc
copywritten but still bitten they almost sound like
almost pumpin but it ain't down like
a record's supposed to sound watch as it go around
records are broken smashed into the ground
that ain't my melody brothers keep runnin' up and tellin' me
others are trying to flow smooth and steadily
potholes are left in my path then i crash and bruise
whoever refuse and cruise right past em
'cause i just left to do it for easy whatever
death till i get back you better stay in step
after speaking you'll stare if i was there your description is
letters full of poetical medicine this is for the listeners",1

you name the day the grounds to be neutral
speak your piece the feeling's mutual
we can go topic from topic whenever i drop it
try to stop it
in other words what the brother heard
he tried to catch it but what occurred
was too much weight for one brain to take
try to concentrate maintain then elevate

the matter of weight can't hold my mind down
permanent damage i do away with
no time for fun 'cause i don't play with

it ain't a memorex live in concert
at every network the r the expert
whoever goes against causes friction

to beat or defeat me because whenever i
put poetry in motion
from the nile then out into the ocean

seven days a week at a quake or a slow rate

creator the alphabets let's communicate
when i translate the situation's straight
no dictionary's necessary to use
big words do nothing but confuse and lose
from the first step a concept was kept

made by the r of course
seven holes in my face as i'm lookin' out my window
speak with the beat and it seem like the wind blows
through the speakers i hear it so pump this
and we can fill up the whole circumfrence
with competition on an impossible mission
comin' up with nothin' keep fishin
no runner up just lost or forfeits
they all get butterflies soon as the dog gets
unlocked lines for blocks and blocks
might be triflin to call the cops
bring along paramedics
but that won't help you not even calisthetics

you wondered how come the album was late

keep you in tune and up to par
then you're doing it with the r
doing it wit the r

something new and to keep you doing what'cha doing
this is for you and your crew and for who in
the vicinity i don't need no identity
i see hands in the air that means many be
cooperating i can't stop relating
hip-hop is making more sense when i'm stating
paragraphs of potential to prevent you
from using my instrumental keep in mind i meant to
illustrate another iller break immediately
hurry up and learn the words and repeat it wit me
then soon you're in tune and up to par
and then you're doing it wit the r
keep doing it you keep doing it wit the r

in the summertime pockets bulging
somethings's happening then i'm indulging
music is mine gucci seats reclined
gold grill a paint job will shine
pull up in the park and then pop the trunk
turn up the bass and let the system thump
a block party starts to form people start to swarm
loud as a ghetto blaster word is bond

when all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure?
release then veins in the brains increase
when i let off make a wish and blow the smoke off my piece
unloadin unfold and the rhymes are explodin

cordless cause the wire caught fire like a fuse
gunpowder and the slightest bruise is a friction
the outcome is there so listen
here's the brief description
a boom then flame then smoke ashes a dust to dust
contact is compact when i bust
mc's are now in a massacre
a disaster a master at fashion a beat to death
to a pulp till it can't pump
speakers ain't sayin' nothin'
now the ball can thump
as i'm lookin' i stand like great buildings in brooklyn
then the stage is took then
havoc struck that could product a whole court
keep in touch with the mic when you're holdin' y'all
sumpin and pumpin and slobbin and droolin
nothin's pumpin who do you think ya foolin?
tommy tucker the neighborhood sucker
what you oughtta do is pick up a tempo
from what i invent so hard not to bite but you can't prevent so
you start to kidnap
i watch the kid rap
when he get off he know he shouldn't a did that
minor old-timer weak-rhymer stay-in-liner
you won't be inclined to go so yo
maybe later you're gonna be
but for now you're almost one of me
now the immature imitations taken from originations
made by tracin and a little arrangin
so perform if ya still ain't warm maybe after
a roast by the host with the most it's a musical massacre

never tired don't even try it keep quiet
like a storm you could rain but a riot
remains the gangs power just like the towerin inferno
the beat's gonna burn so
distance i kept ou better watch your step
volunteers go from here and get
ya out of the flames
appreciate the temperature change
anywhere within the range of celcius
fahrenheit on the mic mic melts see it
burns soon as it's felt see it's torchin scorchin
mic's pipin hot steamin who's schemin now ya not
james brown must a been dusted
disgusted now he can't be trusted
embalmed with fluid
static can cause an explosion in fact impact's closin in
time was up so i don't need a time bomb
beat gives me a heat-stroke when i rhyme calm
pull out the tool sometimes i wanna break fool
but i was cool like one in the chamber
lets play a game of rhymin roulette
and put me up to your brain and name a rhyme about ya clout
one mistake ya out
if this imitation it can't be the same show
maybe what you'll find somewhere over the rainbow
courage heart brain you need rhyme
turn on your mic snap your fingers three times
we gone or the story won't end the same
and you'll feel the flame
the potion was weak make another antidote
what's the science? why can't ya quote?
elements for musical intelligence
rhymes are irrelevant no development
and that settles it
go manufacture a match send me after a blast
from the master that has to make musical massacre",1
0,"voice so you're a philosopher?
krs yes i think very deeply
repeated and scratched

verse one
let's begin what where why or when
will all be explained like instructions to a game
see i'm not insane in fact i'm kind of rational
when i be asking you who is more dramatical?
this one or that one the white one or the black one
pick the punk and i'll jump up to attack one
krs-one is just the guy to lead a crew
right up to your face and dis you
everyone saw me on the last album cover
holding a pistol something far from a lover
beside my brother s-c-o-t-t
i just laughed cause no one can defeat me
this is lecture number two my philosophy
number one was poetry you know it's me
this is my philosophy many artists got to learn
i'm not flammable i don't burn
so please stop burnin and learn to earn respect
'cause that's just what kr collects
see what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk
you walk down the street and get jumped
you got to have style and learn to be original
and everybody's gonna wanna diss you
like me we stood up for the south bronx
and every sucka mc had a response
you think we care? i know that they are on the tip
my posse from the bronx is thick
and we're real live we walk correctly
a lot of suckas would like to forget me
but they can't cause like a champ
i have got a record of knocking out the frauds in a second
on the mic i believe that you should get loose
i haven't come to tell you i have juice
i just produce create innovate on a higher level
i'll be back but for now just seckle

verse two
i'll play the nine and you play the target
you all know my name so i guess i'll just start it
or should i say start this i am an artist
of new concepts at their hardest
cause yo i'm a teacher and scott is a scholar
it ain't about money 'cause we all make dollars
that's why i walk with my head up
when i hear wack rhymes i get fed up
rap is like a set-up a lot of games
a lot of suckas with colorful names
i'm so-and-so i'm this i'm that
huh but they all just wick-wick-wack
i'm not white or red or black
i'm brown from the boogie down
productions of course our music be thumpin'
others say their bad but they're buggin
let me tell you somethin' now about hip hop
about d-nice melodie and scott la rock
i'll get a pen a pencil a marker
mainly what i write is for the average new yorker
some mc's be talkin' and talkin'
tryin' to show how black people are walkin'
but i don't walk this way to portray
or reinforce stereotypes of today
like all my brothas eat chicken and watermelon
talk broken english and drug sellin'
see i'm tellin' and teaching real facts
the way some act in rap is kind of wack
and it lacks creativity and intelligence
but they don't care cause the company is sellin' it
it's my philosophy on the industry
don't bother dissin me or even wish that we'd
soften dilute or commercialize all our lyrics
'cause it's about time one of y'all hear it
and hear it first-hand from the intelligent brown man
a vegetarian no goat or ham
or chicken or turkey or hamburger
'cause to me that's suicide self-murder
let us get back to what we call hip hop
and what it meant to dj scott la rock

verse three
how many mc's must get dissed
before somebody says don't f with kris
this is just one style out of many
like a piggy bank this is one penny
my brother's name is kenny - that's kenny parker
my other brother icu is much darker
boogie down productions is made up of teachers
the lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker
who gets weaker? the king or the teacher
it's not about a salary it's all about reality
teachers teach and do the world good
kings just rule and most are never understood
if you were to rule or govern a certain industry
all inside this room right now would be in misery
no one would get along nor sing a song
'cause everyone'd be singing for the king am i wrong?
so yo what's up it's me again
scott la rock krs bdp again
many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend
we're criminal minded an album which is only ten
funky funky funky funky funky hit records
no more than four minutes and some seconds
the competition checks and checks and keeps checkin'
they buy the album take it home and start sweatin'
why? well it's simple to them it's kind of vital
to take krs-one's title
to them i'm like an idol some type of entity
in everybody's rhyme they wanna mention me?
or rather mention us me or scott la rock
but they can get bust get robbed get dropped
i don't play around nor do i f around
and you can tell by the bodies that are left around
when some clown jumps up to get beat down
broken down to his very last compound
see how it sounds? a little unrational
a lot of mc's like to use the word dramatical
fresh for '88 you suckas",1
1,"yo man these people around here in '87 just slippin-dough you know what
i'm sayin'? boogie down productions not slippin-dough so hold ya hands-you
know what i'm sayin'? word yo what's goin' on? mr magic-you know what
happened? he slipped on us-he die pumpin kiss fm we rock to my man dj
red alert- we chillin' word yo man yo do heard about man this shit
about this kid-wearin' the ah jerry curls man word up he was slippin'
yo dough word up word up he had a yellow coat on but no description was
given

now what you just heard people was a little kickin
but let me tell you this while the clock is still tickin
this is the warning known as the caution
do not attempt to dis 'cause you'll soften
just like a pillow or better yet a mattress
you can't match this style or attack this
while i'm telling you write on schedule
fuck with k-r-s and i'll bury you
deep in the dirt or sand with a shovel
no fight no scurry or scuffle just muffle
total domination on stage
kris is the name 22 is the age
those who wanna battle i know who you are
you got a little girl you drive a little car
you're coming into the place with that look on your face
before you ran the mile you lost the race
so assume you're doomed when you step in the room
i'll be the witch and you'll be the broom
i'll ride you guide you into the concrete
i'll slide you to a funky beat
so what do we have here?
a sucka in fear
i snatched your heart
put it way up on the chart
at ten you're fucked
at nine you suck
at eight you're a sucker
at seven a mothafucka
at six you're slapped
at five you're just whacked
at four you're lost
at three you're just soft
at two you're an ass
at one you're a dick
but before you slip i'll whip
'cause homeboy you're slippin'

yo get my slip on i'm chillin' on a long time ya see me slip on crop d
and i'll slip on everybody-i slip on sayin'? i'll come back if i miss you
sayin'?

i understand that music calms the savage beast
but keep in mind that i compose my music piece by piece
first a bass a snare
a little cut over there
i add my name k-r-s
and the shit becomes fresh
i ask moe and icu for their thoughts
layin' down a power play all the suckas are tought
one again the tactics of original arts
we're gettin' paid to the end 'cause we were down from the start
we're known as boogie down productions ain't no b-boy stance
gauranteed to make you dance if you give us a chance
we're goin' off and of course all you suckas are lost
you wanna hear a fresh rhyme? you've come to the source
because i'm the type of guy that's not put up on a pedestal
run my rhymes on time and on schedule
one after another another to the next
can't rhyme when you're tense or your muscles are flexed
check your larynex
it may get low in havin' sex
or may get higher when busted as a liar
these are the things i teach so be tought
to me you're kinda short how many battles have you fought?
if you come up with a number notebook or list
it just doesn't matter you can still get dissed
i'll bring it back that ol' new york rap
that gets you jacked while you're hands still clap
it's funny
just dissin' you i can make money
but no one's tippin'
my message is simple ya' slippin

they slippin'-dough-1987-they slippin' but we goin' all the way to the top
man word-you know what i'm sayin'? to my brother krs-1 you're large i'm
sayin' large-every time man large they're slippin'

e-n-o s-r-k
when you go through other albums you're sure to say
goddam they all seem to sound alike
till you hear the crew standin' over in the light
showing glowing on the top growing
the lyrics keep flowing and flowing and just flowing
just like a river or better yet a stream
i'm proud to be down with the winning team
so don't ever in your life even think about an argument
'cause you'll get walked on like carpet
we'll pick you up and dust you off
stamp bdp on you're head and you're off
but you won't even change that to say instead
i'm down 'cause i got a bdp on my head
so just before you inherit that ass kicking
i suggest you wake right up 'cause ya slippin'

yo they slippin'-dough they slippin'-dough they slippin'-word up i
don't care no more man i'm commin' out of the shell-dough they slippin'
man b-boy records magic yo all the time they slippin-ya know what i'm
saying? this other kid-i don't know what his name is but you know what time

one two three the crew is called bdp
and if you want to go to the tip top
stop the violence in hip-hop y-o

time and time again as i pick up the pen
as my thoughts emerge these are those words
i glance at the paper to know what's going on
someone's doing wrong the story goes on
mary lue just had a baby someone else decapitated
the drama of the world shouldn't keep us so frustrated
i look but it doesn't coincide with my books
social studies won't speak about political crooks
it's just the presidents and all the money they spent
all the things they invent and how the house is so immaculate
they create missiles while family's eat gristle
then they get upset when the press blows the whistle
phone calls are made profiles are kept low
you temper with some jobs now the press is controlled
not only newspapers but every single station
you only get to hear the president is on vacation
but um stay calm there's no need for alarm
you say good bye to your mom and you're off to vietnam
you shoot to kill come back and you're a veteran
but how many veterans are out there pedaling?
there's no telling 'cause they continue selling
as quiet as it's kept i won't go into depth
you can talk about nigeria people used to laugh at ya
now i take a look i see usa for africa?

huh
what's the solution to stop all this confusion?
rewrite the constitution change the drug which you're using
rewrite the constitution or the emancipation proclamation
we fight inflation yet the president's still on vacation

bdp posse
i say one two three the crew is called bdp
and if you wanna go to the tip top
stop the violence in the hip-hop y-o

this might sound a little strange to you


well here's the reason i came to you
we gotta put our heads together and stop the violence
cause real bad boys move in silence
when you're in a club you come to chill out
not watch someone's blood just spill out
that's what these other people want to see
another race fight endlessly
you know we're being watched you know we're being seen
some wish to destroy this scene called hip-hop
but i won't stop
not i or scott larock
now here is the message that we bring today
hip-hop will surely decay
if we as a people don't stand up and say
stop the violence
stop the violence
stop the violence
stop the violence
stop the violence

i say one two three the crew is called bdp
and if you wanna go to the tip top
stop the violence in the hip-hop y-o

bdp and me
we step into the party top celebrity
say when we're coming to dance we never have to pay a fee
cause that's where we got r-e-s-p-e-c-t
i have this one wife her name is miss melody
i know i'm from the bronx she from the brooklyn posse
i tell ya look a little like this then i tell you some that i
sometimes i got my gear on sometimes i wear a hat
sometimes i'm in a mercedes and sometimes i'm in a plain
sometimes i find myself upon the number two train
some people look at me and see negativity
some people look at me and see positivity
but when i see myself i see creativity
so if i can create well then i make some money
sha man just put your hands up if you're out here gettin' paid
sha man just put your hands up if you're out here gettin' paid

one afternoon around eleven o'clock
it was freezing cold
he was standing on the block
sellin' cheeba
mixin' dimes
sayin' a rhyme
just to pass the time
the cops passed by
but he stayed calm
'cause the leather trench coat
was keepin' him warm
but this time they walked by real slowly
he thought to himself
they look like they know me
they drove away
but he didn't stay
he jumped in the cab
and he paid his tab
but guess who he saw
when he hit the block
it was the same cop car
the same two cops
they jumped out quick
they pulled a gun
they said don't try to fight
and don't try to run
cooperate and we will be your friend
non-cooperation will be your end
he jumped in the car
and wile they rode
they ran down the list of things he owed
they said you owe us some money
you owe us some product
'cause you could be right
in the river tied up
he thought for a second and he said
what is this?
you want me to pay you
to stay in business?
they said that's right or you go to prison
'cause nobody out there is really gonna listen
to a hood so he said good
i'll pay you off for the whole neighborhood

a guy named jack is selling crack
the community doesn't want him back
he sells at work
he sells in schools
he's not stupid the cops are the fools
'cause everyone else
seems to go to jail
but when it comes to jack
the cops just fail
they can't arrest him
they cannot stop him
'cause even in jail
the bail unlocks him
so here is the deal
and here is the facts
if you ever wonder why
they can't stop crack
the police department
is like a crew
it does whatever they want to do
in society you have illegal and legal
we need both to make things equal
so legal is tobacco
illegal is speed
legal is aspirin
illegal is weed
crack is illegal 'cause they cannot stop ya
but cocaine is legal if its owned by a doctor
everything you do in private is illegal
everything's legal if they government can see you
don't get me wrong
america is great place to live

now here's what we do on the 48-track board
we look around for the best possible break
and once we find it we just break
 or we just break {nerrrrrrrr-vous}
there's two ways to do this you see what i'm sayin'?
if you feel the board you feel around
we got tracks one to track 48

makin' funky music is a must
i'm number one

people still takin' rappin' for a joke
a passing hope or a phase with a rope
sometimes i choke and try to believe
when i get challenged by a million mcs
i try to tell them we're all in this together
my album was raw because no-one would ever
think like i think and do what i do
i stole the show and then i leave without a clue

what do you think makes up a krs?
concisive teaching or very clear speaking?
ridiculous bass aggravating treble
rebel renegade must stay paid
not by financial aid but a raid of hits
causing me to take long trips
i'm the original teacher of this type of style
rockin' off-beat with a smile
or smirk or chuckle yes some are not up to
bdp posse so i love to
step in the jam and slam
i'm not superman because anybody can
or should be able to rock off turntables
grab the mic plug it in and begin
but here's where the problem starts no heart
because of that a lot of groups fell apart
rap is still an art and no-one's from the old school
'cause rap is still a brand-new tool
i say no-one's from the old school 'cause rap on a whole
isn't even twenty years old
fifty years down the line you can start this
'cause we'll be the old school artists
and even in that time i'll say a rhyme
a brand-new style ruthless and wild
runnin' around spendin' money havin' fun
'cause even then i'm still number one

blastmaster krs-one of course
comes to express with style the lost
ways of rhyming old and new past and present
knock knock who is it?
a brand-new style hup time to change
people talk about me when they see me on stage
live in action guaranteed raw
i hang with the rich and i work for the poor
now tomorrow you can say you saw
krs-one stompin' once more
i play by ear i love to steer
the alfa romeo from here to there
i grab the beer but not in the ride
'cause i'm not stupid i don't drink and drive
i'm not a beginner amateur or local
my album is sellin' because of my vocals
you know what you need to learn?
old school artists don't always burn
you're just another rapper who's had his turn
now it's my turn and i am concerned
about idiots posing as kings
what are we here to rule?
i thought we were supposed to sing
and if we oughta sing then let us begin to teach
many of you are educated open your mouth and speak
krs-one is something like a total renegade
except i don't steal i rhyme to get paid
airplanes flyin' overseas people dyin'
politicians lyin' i'm tryin'
not to escape but hit the problem head-on
by bringin' out the truth in a song
so bdp short for boogie down productions
made a little noise 'cause the crew was sayin' somethin'
people have the nerve to take me for a gangster
an ignorant one something closer to a prankster
doin' petty crimes goin' straight to penitentiary
but in a scale of crime that's really elementary
this beat is now compelling me to explain in silence
why my last jam was so violent
it's simple bdp will teach reality
no beatin' around the bush straight up just like the p is free
so now you know a poet's job is never done
but i'm never overworked 'cause i'm still number one

kool moe dee he's down with us
eric b and rakim they're down with us
stetsasonic they're down with us
dana dane he's down with us
sleeping bag records they're down with us
my lawyer jay he's down with us
jive/rca is down with us
makin' funky music is a must
i'm number one",1

t'cha t'cha that boy is a t'cha

i want you all to understand i'm down with bdp
i got so many styles but i'm not an mc
i am a teacher teaching rap and of course i am back
because these other mc's are here also weak and wack
so bdp will teach them hey we will teach them
bdp will teach them hey we will teach them
all about the guy who first is down but then he lies
what he is to you he's a part time sucker

among thousands and thousands of very good mc's
a poet will flow like the breeze
like the wind air is all around us
from what i hear it's a good thing you found us
and in a hurry just in the nick of time
'cause i do four things rhyme produce teach and bring to you new styles
well here's the first style right out the pile
it's called vocabulary difficult isn't it?
at least is looks that way when you witness it
kill kill? meaning to deprive of life
fiancee future wife
poet poet a person who writes poems
wandering meaning to roam
everyone sees me when i walk into the public
even the suckers i just love it
when they get disgusted every time i prove
boogie down pro boogie down productions will move
meaning to motivate lest rhyme straight
hate is a very very big mistake
it rhymes with frustrate and aggravate
let me just demonstrate why i won't abbreviate
television a view of scenes transmitted
every single second you get it
pepsi what? the choice of a new generation
fired from work termination
quality something special about an object or person
can you rock a party without rehearsing?
i can anytime on the spot rhyme
many recording artists can't do it but i'm
more than just a recording artist kicking dust who?
i'm a sandstorm taking human form
k plus r s equals one
i don't burn anymore i just cook till you're done
and when you're done then i serve
like alphabet soup letters letters words words
sentences chunks of meat into a paragraph
get the meaning then ask the question 'bout the guy
who first is down but then he lies
what he is to you he's a part time sucker

kewe-kewe-k arewa-arewa-r ewe-ewe-s my rhymes are fresh
please step back let me progress
meaning to advance you only get a glance
of me at a time sayin' some rhyme
or sayin' some rekkid that should respect it select it
i'm never ever wack or reject it
challenge bdp it get's dissed expect it
i travel the nation by mostly plane
i travel new york by either cab or the train
some say that i'm insane they say
why would you want to ride the train
but i but i don't care as long as i get there
i never used to pay my fare but now i think i got to
because from a jail cell i can't rock you
that's being incarcerated meaning locked up
a tool a tool for holding water is a cup or pail
the opposite for fresh is stale
the largest the largest sea-mammal is a whale
beer is called ale or sometimes it is called brew
a group a a group of human beings is a crew
you know what i'm gonna do? explain criminal minded
cause much too many people still are blinded
let me rewind it and elaborate on blinded meaning can't see through me
he he he he he these people make me laugh
the way they like to change up the past
so when you're there in class learning 'his story'
learn a little of your story the real story
it doesn't pay to know the life and times of someone else
it doesn't benefit your wealth or your mental health
i go for self but the real self is one with all
this self who's by himself does fall
down just like the guy who first was down but then he lies
what he is to you he's a part time sucker

9,"when some get together and think of rap they tend to think of violence
but when they are challenged on some rock group the result is always silence
even before the rock and roll era violence played a big part in music
it's all according to your meaning of violence and how or in which way you use it
no it's not violent to show in movies the destruction of the human body
but yes of course it's violent to protect yourself at a party
and oh no it's not violent when under the christmas tree is a look-alike gun
but yes of course it's violent to have an album like krs-one
by all means necessary it's time to end the hypocrisy
what i call violence i can't do but your kind of violence is stopping me
by all means necessary the rap audience must grow up
the same type of fightin' we do they do except we've got nothing to blow up
it doesn't matter if you win or lose it's only how good you play the game
this is the oldest sneak attack because it takes away our senses to gain
if all i do is play the game then i am just mediocre
we strive to be the best we can be not to just get over
some people say that life on a whole is serious and nothing is funny
that's only if you base your life around competition and money
yeah i'm making some money he's making some money but none of these things are necessities
what i find to be a necessity is controlling a positive destiny
with this money fame glory and credit will come in time
the people down with me know this every minute they hear me sayin' rhymes
i got some friends i got some allies like stet and big daddy kane
they know that by all means necessary that peace is the name of this game
whether peace by war or peace by peace the reality of peace is scary

yeah

verse 1 - chuck d
step back get away - give the brother some room
you got to all turn me up when the beat goes boom
lyric to lyric - line to line
then you y'all understand my reputation for rhyme
cause my rhyme reputation depends on what
style of record my dj cuts
his slice an' dice - super mix so nice
so bad you won't dispute the price
'cause it's plain to see - it's a strain to be
number one in the public eye enemy
'cause i'm wanted in 50 - almost 51
states where the posse got me on the run
it's a big wonder why i haven't gone under
dodgin' all types of microphone thunder
a fugitive missin' all types of hell
all this because i talk so well
when i

rock - get up - get down
miuzi weighs a ton
hold it

verse 2 - chuck d
the match up title - the expression of thrill
for elite to compete and attempt to get ill
if looks could kill - i'd chill until
all the public catches on to my material - you know
the ducks criticize my every phase of rapture
can't wait to read the headlines of my capture
accused of assault - a 1st degree crime
'cause i beat competitors with my rhyme
tongue whipped pushed shoved and tripped
choked from the hold of my kung fu grip
and if you want my title - it would be suicidal
from my end - it would be homicidal
when i do work - you get destroyed
all the paranoid - know to avoid
the public enemy seat i've enjoyed
this is no kid and i'm not no toy boy

rock - get up - get down
miuzi weighs a ton
hold it

verse 3 - chuck d
i'm a public enemy but i don't rob banks
i don't shoot bullets and i don't shoot blanks
my style is supreme - number one is my rank
and i got more power than the new york yanks
if miuzi wasn't heavy i'd probably fire it
i'd make you walk the plank if i was a pirate
if they made me a king - i would be a tyrant
if you want to get me - go ahead and try it
snatcher dispatcher biter never been a
instead of takin' me out - take a girl to dinner
the level of comp has never been thinner
it's a runaway race where i'm the winner
it's unreal - they call the law
and claimed i had started a war
it was war they wanted and war they got
but they wilted in the heat when miuzi got hot

rock - get up - get down
miuzi weighs a ton
hold it

verse 4 - chuck d
my style versatile said without rhymes
which is why they're after me an' on my back
lookin' over my shoulder - seein' what i write
hearin' what i say - then wonderin' why
why they can't ever compete on my level
superstar status is my domain
understand my rhythm - my pattern of lecture
and then you'll know why i'm on the run
this change of events results in a switch
it's the lateral movement of my vocal pitch
it eliminates pressure on the haunted
but the posse is around so i got to front it
plus employ tactics so coy
and leave no choice but to destroy
soloists groups and what they say
and all that try to cross my way
when i


rock - get up - get down
miuzi weighs a ton
hold it

yeah that's right
public enemy number one in new york
public enemy number one in philly
public enemy number one in dc
public enemy number one in cleveland ohio
also where public enemy number one in st louis
public enemy number one in new jersey
and bust it
where also public enemy number one in cincinnati
in atlanta",1

verse 1 - chuck d
you go ooh and ah when i jump in my car
people treat me like kareem abdul jabbar
no matter who you are when i'm up to par
i betcha go hip hop hurray or hurrah
but the ahhs and ohhs is my kind of news
pop your tape in put your car in cruise
i never heard the boos i never drank booze
'cause i just rock the rhythm left alone the blues

a look and then you know that we're never weak
i know you can't wait it's never too late
no fear i'm here and everything is straight
cycles cycles life runs in cycles
new is old no i'm not no psycho
the monkey on the back makes the best excel
the people in the crowd makes the rock well
the people in the back lets you know who's whack
and those who lack the odds are stacked
the one who makes the money is white not black
you might not believe it but it's like that
when you come to my show watch me throw
down with the other brothers toe to toe
when you make a move new not used
and watch the bro here just bust a groove
a fat lady soprano loads my ammo
and hear my jam with a funky piano
easy on the wall but hard on the panel
a fool smokes kools 'cause he chokes on camels
in effect the crew's in check
run by the posse with the gold around the neck
homeboys in heat lookin' for sweet
ladies in the crowd so they can meet
somebody to body makin' a baby

'cause i can go solo like a tyson bolo
make the fly girls wanna have my photo
run in their room hang it on the wall
in remembrance that i rocked them all

take this application of rhymes like these
my rap's red hot 110 degrees

i don't break in stores but i break all laws
written while sitting all bidding not hidden
giving me the juice that you're not getting
i'm not a law obeyer so you can tell your mayor

i'm the rhyme player the ozone layer
a battle what? here's a bible so start your prayer
this word to the wise is justified
if they ask you what happened just admit you lied
you just got caught up for going out of order
and now you're serving football teams their water
you messed with the master word to chuck

some brothers act hard but the rest are jockin
because i'm housin 4x

i come on strong like a bodybuilder
cast a spell upon a sucker like witch matilda
deliver a rhyme like federal express
my intention's not to dis but impress
for the ladies and gents the money was spent
to see the e-p-double-e-m-d yes the main event
in concert not worried bout oos 'n' boos because we do work
to make your body jerk
to make your girl want to leave her man and start to flirt
with the p double-e md double e'n
i'm not skeezing but pleasing
all party goers also behind show-ers
who like the not fast slow flow of rhymes that form in my dome
out the mouth to the microphone

so a brother like md takes a chill and lay low
hypnotize your girl while the funk flow

he drives i rhyme no matter what we win
i come fully equipped with the mic on my hip
so if you real it's no time to slip
'cause when it's time for some action check on the mic-hael jackson
do a spin grab my nuts and start taxin
let the mc's know that i shock like lightning
they mess with the e-double-e i sounds frightening

parrish so let the funk flow

erick sermon
blastoff and off you go
we usually take off fast but now we take up slow
i would say ?bamba yards? but i'm not leavin'
i don't wanna go but the girlies keep screamin
so i will stay if that's fine wit you
but i won't leave until the party is through
so while i'm here let me get funky
fiendin for the rhyme like a four-deuce junkie
put the pep in your step the stride in your glide

while the bass is steady pumpin and the beat be like thumpin
you lose your cool then you start jumpin'
you're out of control and i'm right on track
in seconds later i work the bone out your back
to mess with the two is to mess with hot water
we like to hang torture then slaughter
all sucker mc's who proceed to intrude
e said let 'em slide say what but i'm in the mood
for dishin and dismissin all those who don't listen
reel the ones whose in as if we was fishin

cause in eighty-seven you bit on the old bait

erick so let the funk flow

parrish smith
lounge homeboy you in the danger zone
when the brother pmd is on the microphone
the slow momentum of my rhymes are divine and combined
to go off beat and come back on time
to maintain and explain but never sound the same
and when it comes to do this very few remain
people on my jock for the rhymes i invent
dip in a phone booth just like clark kent
step out dressed to impress with no intention to fess
chillin' hard with the p on my chest
rhymin on the mic while the beat rocks steady
throw a funky fresh rhyme and mc's fetch it like freddy

erick sermon
listen to heavy metal hardcore rock 'n' roll
drink a six-pack maybe miller or stroh

the love that y'all playin' and screamin had to stop
let's get it straight for nineteen eighty-eight
for it can sound fine for nineteen eighty-nine

2,"well this girl came up to me she says she's new in town
but the crew been said they seen her around
i thought they were right but i didn't wanna know
the girlie was def and she wanted to go

i think her name is lucy but they all call loose
i think i thought i seen her on eighth and forty-deuce
the next thing she said was my place or yours?
let's kick some bass behind closed doors

we got into the cab the cab driver said
he recognized my girlie from the back of her head
he said a little something about tip to base
so i made him stop the cab to get out of the place

i shouldn't have looked back man i'll always regret it
something's going on and i'll probably never get it
she was crying like a baby stupid dumb
it's just too bad that girl's a bum

she's crafty - she's gets around
she's crafty - she's always down
she's crafty - she's got a gripe
she's crafty - and she's just my type
she's crafty

i spent my last dollar to buy a sabrett
when i seen this girl i could never forget
now i like nothing better than a pretty girl smile
and i haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while

the girl came up to me she said she loved the show
asked her to come home and she couldn't say no
we got the crib - there's adam and d
we didn't say a word - they just stared at me

i said i don't know her just met her tonight
and ad-rock started hiding everything in sight
d pulled me over said hide your gold
the girl is crafty like ice is cold

the girl is crafty she knows all the moves
i started playing records she knew all the grooves
he thought she was a thief and d was right
but i'm just thinkin' she'd spend the night

when i woke up late in the afternoon
she had taken all the things from inside his room
i found myself naked in the middle of the floor
she had taken the bed and the chest of drawers

the mirror the tv the new guitar cord
my remote control and my old skateboard
she robbed us blind she took all we owned
and the boys blamed me for bringing her home

she's crafty - she's gets around
she's crafty - she's always down
she's crafty - she's got a gripe
she's crafty - and she's just my type
she's crafty

oh yeah

she's crafty - she's gets around
she's crafty - she's always down
she's crafty - she's got a gripe
she's crafty - and she's just my type

she's crafty - she's gets around
she's crafty - she's always down
she's crafty - she's got a gripe
she's crafty - and she's just my type

i keep a pistol in my pocket so you better be cautious
fly around the world but it makes me nauseous

mike d's day off everyday of the week
i got to the party and i did the freak
i got a girl in the castle and one in the pagoda

i'm a def manhattan killer a rhyme driller
a mike in my hand and a mouth full of miller
i got a hat not a visor i drink budweiser

i know that i'm fly man there's no need to flatter
i travel around the globe it's keeping girlies dizzy
my name's mike d now watch me get busy y'all

you're a fake wearin' sucker whose gold got rusted
cheaper than a hot dog with no mustard
you tried to steal my fresh and you got cold busted
because your crew's all soft and i'm disgusted

i'm from downtown from the city of manhattan
i got a lotta girlies and not one's cattin'
my posse's in effect and we're doin' the do

we went to white castle and we got thrown out

so i reached in the miller cooler grabbed a cool bud

slow riding gun hidin' on the go
i'm fly like an eagle and i drink old crow
i'm the king of the classroom coolin' in the back
my teacher had beef so i gave her a smack

she chased me out of class she was strapped with a ruler
went to the bathroom rolled myself a wooler
with bottle in hand at the microphone stand
ay yo homeboy - what you drinkin' man

i got money - i got juice
i got to the party and i got loose
i got rhythms - i got rhymes

i got gold - i got funky
i got the new dance - they call the brass monkey

because i'm hard hittin' - always bitten - cool as hell

sittin' around the house - gettin' high and watchin' tube
i'm eating colonel's chicken - drinkin' heineken brew

i'm a gangster i'm a prankster - i'm the king of the ave

and in the morning it's girls
'cause in the evening it's girls

i like the way that they walk
and it's chill to hear them talk
and i can always make them smile
from white castle to the nile

back in the day
there was this girl around the way
she liked my home-piece mca
he said he would not give her play

i asked her please? - she said you may
her pants were tight and that's okay
if she would dance i would dj
we took a walk down to the bay

i hope she'll say
hey me and you should hit the hay
i asked her out she said no way
i should have probably guessed her gay

so i broke north with no delay
i heard she moved real far away
that was two years ago this may
i seen her just the other day

jockin' mike d to my dismay

girls - to do the dishes
girls - to clean up my room
girls - to do the laundry

8,"now here's a little story i gots to tell
about three bad brothers you know so well
it started way back in history
with ad-rock mca and me mike d

i  had a little horsey named paul revere
just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
ridin' cross the land kickin' up sand
sheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause i'm in demand

one lonely beastie i be
all by myself without nobody
the sun is beatin' down on my baseball hat
the air is gettin' hot the beer is gettin' flat

lookin' for a girl i ran into a guy
his name is mca i said howdy he said hi

he told a little story that sounded well rehearsed
four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
the brew was in my hand and he was on my tip
his voice was hoarse his throat was dry he asked me for a sip

he said can i get some?
i said you can't get none
i had a chance to run
but he pulled out his shotgun
quick on the draw i thought i'd be dead
he put the gun to my head and this is what he said

now my name is mca i got a license to kill
i think you know what time it is it's time to get ill
so what do we have here? an outlaw and his beer
i run this land you understand i've made myself clear

we stepped into the wind he had a gun i had a grin
as if this story's over but it's ready to begin

i've got the gun you've got the brew
you've got two choices of what you can do
it's not a tough descision as you can see
i can blow you away or you can ride with me

i said i'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
the sheriff is after me for what i did to his daughter
i did it like this i did it like that
i did it with the whiffle ball bat

so i'm on the run the cop's got my gun
and right about now it's time to have some fun
the king ad-rock that is my name
and i know the fly spot where they got the champagne

we rode for six hours then we hit the spot
the beat was-a-bumpin' and the girlies was hot
this dude was starin' like he knows who we are
we took the empty spot next to him at the bar

mca said yo you know this kid?
i said i didn't but i knew he did
the kid said get ready cuz this ain't funny
my name is mike d and i'm about to get money

he pulled out the jammy aimed it at the sky
he yelled stick 'em up and let two fly
hands went up and people hit the floor
he wasted two kids that ran for the door

i'm mike d and i get respect
your cash and your jewelry is what i expect
mca what with it and he's my ace
so i grabbed the piano player and punched him in the face

the piano player's out the music stopped
this boy had beef and he got dropped
mike d grabbed the money mca snatched the gold
i grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold",1

i don't go outside i like to stay inside

i'm in love with the pizznoot it's proper as hell
i'm hittin harder than hard always makin' her yell
she's cooler than an iceberg word to the mother
in the house down the steps and under the covers
right away no sation or frontin or playin'
or delayin i'm never steppin off i'm always stayin
her mother knows me well father hates my guts
he don't know when we're alone she's always feelin' on my niggy-niggy-nuts
for a snack cornflakes crackerjacks
day after day i try to break that back
and man oh man damn you can't and i can
last time i saw her with man i had to shake almost hands
i said what up he said what up i took your girl so what up?
gotta walk on the ground with a hole to fill up
all the boys laugh about her darryl and dewayne
bobcat and earl but they must be insane
michael spelling's on my side and big chuck the grease

the pope climbed to heaven on a golden rope
ps the lord raised michaelangelo from the dead
so he can make a fresh painting of my head
then i hung out with a king and a queen
and the queen put me down with her polo team
the way i scored points all around the clock
i had her daughter the princess ridin' my jock
i knocked the freak off like a crazy retard
then i took a little trip into a deck of cards
the diamond jack joker and the ace of spades
was amazed at greater cut creator on the fade
then i played cards with the queen of clubs
the queen of hearts with me cold fell in love
as for the queen of diamonds she don't like men
because you know that a diamond is a girl's best friend
the double-trouble spade was named the deuce
and the joker acted stupid so we gave him the news
there was 52 cards and i met everyone
that story is over but my rhyme ain't done

then i took a trip to the center of the earth
i was kinda scared so e-love went first
i met these funny little people they called 'em skeezers
so i held on to my wallet like ebeneezer
tight leather pants that'll make you grunt
two nice soft things right up front
the center of the earth ain't got no crime
just people bodyrockin to the ll rhyme
if you're kinda confused to what a skeezer is
it's just a girl who's on my jock 'cause i'm in showbiz
there was a whole lotta skeezers i dogged everyone

woke up late one afternoon
realized i was in the world of cartoons
he-man told me he'd beat me up
because he thought that i looked like donald duck
then i hung out with spiderman
he told me he was gonna start a comic strip band
the incredible hulk was gonna play the drums
charlie brown grabbed the guitar and started to strum
snoopy tried to rock on the microphone
but tom and jerry both said he should leave it alone
then i hung out with mickey mouse
he had two freaks so we went to his house
mickey's freak was ugly but mine was def
so i knocked it off until there wasn't none left
they were cartoon characters i met everyone

me and e-love met sitting bull
we made a peace pipe then we took a pull
then he brought more leaves from a golden chest

there was a lotta great men and i met everyone

i went inside my tv i met the honeymooners
ralph wanted me to bust a couple of rhymes
but i had my eyes on alice's behind
norton came down right about that time
lookin' in the frigde so he could swine and dine
then i said to myself i should give 'em a taste
so i pulled the microphone out my black briefcase
said it ain't bob hope or barry manilow
then i borrowed norton's hat 'cause i forgot my kangol
ralph said i got a scheme let me get to it

8,"when i'm alone in my room sometimes i stare at the wall
and in the back of my mind i hear my conscience call
telling me i need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
for the first time in my life i see i need love
there i was giggling about the games
that i had played with many hearts and i'm not saying no-names
then the thought occurred tear drops made my eyes burn
as i said to myself look what you've done to her
i can feel it inside i can't explain how it feels
all i know is that i'll never dish another raw deal
playing make believe pretending that i'm true
holding in my laugh as i say that i love you
sayin' amour kissing you on the ear
whispering i love you and i'll always be here
although i often reminisce i can't believe that i found
a desire for true love floating around
inside my soul because my soul is cold
one half of me deserve to be this way till i'm old
but the other half needs affection and joy
and the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy

i need love

romance sheer delight how sweet
i gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
you can scratch my back we'll get cozy and huddle
i'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
i'll give you a rose pull out your chair before we eat
kiss you on the cheek and say ooh girl you're so sweet
it's deja vu whenever i'm with you
i could go on forever tellin' you what i do
but where you at you're neither here nor there
i swear i can't find you anywhere
sure you ain't in my closet or under my rug
this love search is really making me bug
and if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen
take a chance with my love you'll find out what i mean
fantasies can run but they can't hide
when i find you i'm a pour all my love inside

i need love

i wanna kiss you hold you never scold you just love you
suck on your neck caress you and rub you
grind moan and never be alone
if you're not standing next to me you're on the phone
can't you hear it in my voice? i need love bad
i got money but love is something i never had
i need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
i love you more than a man who's ten feet tall
i'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
we're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
our bodies explode in ectasy unreal
you're as soft as a pillow and i'm as hard as steel
it's like a dream-land i can't lie i've never been there
maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
i swear to you this is something i'll never forget

i need love

see what i mean i've changed i'm no longer
a playboy on the run i need something that's stronger
friendship trust honor respect admiration
this whole experience has been such a revelation
it taught me love and how to be a real man
to always be considerate and do all i can
protect you you're my lady and you mean so much
my body tingles all over from the slightest touch
of your hand and understand i'll be frozen in time
till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
if i find you girl i swear i'll be a good man
i'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands
i can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
i gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
i'll search the whole world for that special girl
when i finally found you watch our love unfurl

i need love

girl listen to me
when i be sitting in my room all alone

servin' 'em well
and as you all know
i am - hard - as hell

woke up at 930 on a saturday morn'
hemmed my remote control turned my stereo on
then i reached for a brush since i don't use the picks
and the floor was kinda cold so i put on my kicks
walked to the kitchen and ate some cornflakes
as i bop to a tape of cut creator's breaks
with hardcore - heavyweight - b-boy blast
connoisseur of hardcore and cut creator's fast
jumped in the shower it was boiling hot
so i stayed there a hour 'cause i like it a lot
jumped out dried off put on the denim cologne
then i called up earl on the telephone
he told me 'bout a jam that i could do later on
10 g's plus a limo for one strong song
so i said yeah i was with it hung up and got geared
got a magnfying glass then i brushed my beard
rewound some tapes of some def jam tunes
as i waited for this freak to ring my bell at noon
12 o'clock came left the door crack
the freak walked in a mink on her back
put her curt on the rack threw my ??? on
then i threw in a tape of the quiet storm
we drank roundhill cavern ate soft mignons
she said ll when you're gonna let me taste your tongue?
my skin got pale i wam-bammed the tail
did it so hard i shoulda went to jail
she left earl came over and we went outside
jumped in the bm to bust a joyride
went up to aj in my fresh black wheel
i'm not a sucker on the corner tryin' to scrape up a meal
the girlies want sex the fellas try to plex
but those who flex end up with broke necks
signed some autographs for a posse of freaks
said it's l baby i ain't down with chic
conversated with the skeezers for 10 minutes more
then i jumped in my ride and the freaks slammed the door
due 'cause i'm a gangster people think i do crimes
they don't know i'm just a connoisseur of hip-hop rhymes
some smile try to call ll a hoodlum at times
but he don't know my autograph's on his wife's behind
ll has iced all the washed up slobs
vigilante of rap so to hell with the mob
don't run from the cops makin' suckers jock
and i'm only 18 makin' more than your pops
tormentor of toys and boyscout boys
and i dare any critic to call it noise
peeped at the clock it said 603
said 'later' to creator and broke out with e
went up to white castle for a chocolate shake
thinkin' 'bout a 100'000 that i'd soon make
finished up the snack jumped up out my seat
e-love hit the table and he made up a beat
kicked a few lines stepped out the door
since tonight is a bore i'm in the mood for more
we jumped in my ride i took a peek at the time
it was almost 730 and the show was at nine
ll cool j will soon stand at a jam
with thousands of people screamin touch my hand
but since i had a hour plus a half for tat
i was searchin for the cutie who's my perfect match
her name was renee her face was okay
but she had the kinda body that made jay wanna play
i said no need to rehearse then i made my approach
said you got a good team girl but you need a new coach
said my name's ll - cool if i may introduce
but i'm not here for conversation i'm here to seduce
wanna mix it up baby wanna feel you grind
cause it ain't 5th grade and these ain't nursery rhymes
and i know that you adore my sure side hardcore
check out the real ll behind closed doors
so tell your buddies you're busy tell your boyfriend beat it
forget the silk dress cause you ain't gonna need it
unplug your clock do away with the light
after five minutes or more you hear me say 'that's right'
your body is bad and i heard you got a caddy
when we make love you can call me daddy
i'm ll cool j say hey renee
i'm not a toyboy but i still wanna play
promise you i'm not wack when i'm in the sack
after that i leave you starvin for me to come back
but in the meantime put your digits down
and the next time i see ya i'm goin' to town
stepped away from the freak it was a quarter to nine
when i rolled to the jam i saw the crew on line
took a trip around the side so i could get backstage
if you call me a tiger then the stage is my cage
i rip stomp and crush heavy metal bands rust
them flaky knuckleheads i crumble up like crust
walked in my dressing room and then i heard four knocks
they said ll you're runnin' late and it'is time to rock
told cut creator what the order would be
then i said lord have mercy and slapped hands with e
went onstage i heard the girlies scream
and that's the very moment i woke up from the dream
ah",1

the rap motivator teacher talker night rhyme stalker
words thrillin' so real they're chillin' the hit author

rhyme pays was the name of the album
but that was number one this is the number two
the posse grew we're gonna break through

power

somebody line up the suckers who refuse to recognize the truth
tie up the punks who refuse to understand the youth
my posse's growin' and it's gettin' larger every day
detroit chi-town pittsburgh houston la
come on come on come on toys let's play
circle the calendar perpetrator doomsday
ice t fool man of my own full grown
i cause havoc when i speak upon the microphone
i'm outspoken no jokin' get in my face your jaw will get broken
layin' it sayin' it then you're playing it
lyrics so heavy that you might try weighin' it
hated by many but i hate'em back
loved by troopers who know where it's at
you might like me might think i'm wack
but don't step to me 'cause the boy stays strapped
i'm taking no shorts hatin' the courts hatin' the judges
punk da's with their personal grudges
i hate the clubs that think with their butts
no hats no jeans no sneakers no what?
no beepers no gold? yo kiss my ass
we'll wait and see who gets the last laugh
we'll have the power

power x3

power it starts with p like pussy
she knows she's got it she doesn't worry does she?
spendin' your cash leavin' you in the trash
while your little head's thinkin' they're gone in a dash
they got it know it that's why they show it
the power of sex if man could overthrow it
he'd be king in a day no waywe get rich hard give it away
we're weak and as we speak the girls are hawkin'
sizin' me up straight out as i'm talkin'
but you gotta have control if you want the gold
i don't wanta be alone like stallone
so i keep my mind thinkin' 'bout the green
and stop dwellin' on the in-between
i got the power

power

i'm on a mission mackin' hard as a hammer
take my picture i might take your camera
my posse might move and they move fast
a fool's move could be a punk's last
ain't no criminal although i used to be
ain't no new jack rappin' ain't new to me
i been makin' records on wax since 1982
now it's 1988 finally i'm coming through
that adds up to six years of makin' ok jams but now i'm mad
here comes the body slam
turnin' out concerts house'n the industry
lovin' all the fly girls screamin' for ice t
rollin' with the syndicate my unstoppable battalion
38 solid gold my medalion
gainin' velocity momentum and energy
ice capital t
i got the power

power

so you say that i'm a fake think you really must be a fool
i been to jail more times than you have probably been in school
shot at shot back hit and seen my buddies killed
that's the foundation upon the raps of ice-t are built
i say what i think the system does stink
money you walk you short you're writin' from the klink
come on what's up you know the laws are full of bull
prey on the lame release those with pull
poweri know you wanta try it
well check out money can buy it
control and mold the world to do your wishin'
the knowledge of power is mine so just listen
money controls the world and that's it
and once you got it then you can talk shit
power

you have the power

you have the power

pipe bomb in my trunk got a nine in my lap
i'm layin' for a sprayin' tonight there's no playin'
my posse's most strapped tonight the crew's weighin'
dust is burnin' the steering wheel's turnin'
i'm out a week i'm already earnin'
suckers crossed tonight it's their loss
payback time boy life's the cost
gauges out the window one lay cross the roof
they all die if those suckers ain't bullet proof
i'm rollin' death tollin' of course the car's stolen
but i'm blind to what's wrong all i want is what's golden
a fool in a fight too dumb to know right
fuckin' blue light-read'em their rights

drama x4

copped an alias bailed out in an hour or less
i keep a bank for that don't know about the rest
copped another piece hit the dark streets
rollin' once again fuck the damn police
called up my friend joe a roof job pro459 on his mind car stereos
he said the spot was sleep he cased the joint a week
3 am on the dot inside we creep
got alpines fishes jvc's
motorola phones sony color tv's
had the hide packed up till we heard freeze
fuckin' blue lights-read'em their rights

drama x4

4 in the morning lights in my face
that's the time you know the place
cuffed in the room with the two-way glass
detects in effect cold doggin' my ass
what's your date of birth?what's your real name?
i stuck to my alias i know the game
if they don't know who you are then they don't know what you've done
you're just makin' this harder on yourself son
i know this shit by heart i'm too clever
have you ever been arrested before?
nope never
da reject all over his face
you see no confession no case
then my boy started illin' talkin' and tellin'
son of a bitch-he was a snitch

drama x6

under i went i caught a case and half
he dropped the mallet then the judge laughed
now i'm in the penzo chillin' like a real pro
i can't move until the man says go
a puppet of the big game an institutional thing
i wouldn't be here if i fed my brain
got knowledge from school books instead of street crooks
now all i get is penitentiary hard looks
the joint is like an oven of caged heat
you're just a number another piece of tough meat
killers and robbers are all you great
act soft you will get beat
on death row they got their own hot seat
for those who feel that they are truly elite
the last thing you see's a priest
the lights dim-your life ends

so listen to my words i bring much
sense as i commence my lirycs intense
get telephoto break out your big lens
look check out the sales charts
my record's kickin' i'm breakin' pd's hearts
they banned me from their shows
because they said i'm too hard
but no sell-out i guess i'm just barred
i ain't changin' mine for no body
they bleeped words from doug's la-de-da-de
i can't get a bleep?what's the deal?
maybe my words are just too real
it's not profanity it's just the man and me
he doesn't want you to see what i see
doesn't want you to be what you can be
word censorship of reality

radio suckers never play me x3 sampler of pe rebel without a pause

suckers don't but some do
the real troopers bring the ice to you
and close friends to me yeah public enemy
these stations have high intellect
they don't pretend to be too bourgeois to rock a jam raw
understand what i'm sayin' they're down by law
they play the jams that are right sometimes not polite
they realize you gotta get some people uptight
speak the word your voice will definitely be heard
lie to yourself you're destined to be to the curb
some stations don't care they'll never put on the air
nothin' but commercial junk their brain power's impaired
they don't listen or try to hear what i write
maybe just think once or try some school at night
they're makin' radio wack people have to escape
but even if i'm banned i'll sell a million tapes

radio suckers never play me x3

i made records for music not for the money
to some of you that might sound funny
but i ain't broke and i don't joke
and my lirics are known to make ears smoke
clear as a gun scope i speak the pure dope
can the radio handle the truth?nope
uncut no edits no censors
you can get a plastic rapper from any ol'dispenser
a penny a yard to make a record ain't hard
but to make it mean something that's a job
but then we do it they refuse it
so i tell them duck suckers to cold go screw it
we shouldn't sell out we should just yell out
and get them wack motherfuckers the hell out

radio suckers never play me x4

cruisin' down the street what do i see?
crash task force lapd
gangs illin' wildin' and killin'
hustlers on a roll like they got a million
girls on the strap and you know that
you know the guys will stop wildin' if you stop that crap
but you can't you want money so bad
you'll jock anything with the gucci tag
you gotta have it so the men go get it
robbin' and stealin' soon to regret it
livin' in a jail cell feelin' like a dumbbell
while you jump the next jock well
that's reality that's what i see
nobody says that you have to agree
censorship that ain't the way to be
i thought you said this country was free?

radio suckers never play me x2

tone it downis what they say to me
the fcc will not allow profanity
your subject matter's too hard make a love song
you better get real come on
i ain't no lover i'm a fighter
hard core radical rap rhyme writer
pushin' the botton e does the cuttin'
everything i say amounts to something

take it personal punk i'm talkin' to you

i don't drink or smoke or do dumb drugs
but my posse's still labeled street thugs
lapd's got all my boy's mugs
can't use my phone for the damn bugs
i live in privacy don't like suckers hawking me
news reporters some think they can talk for me
lies misquotes changin' all my words around
but if i catch'em on the street they'll get beat down
they get money for hype-type publicity
they don't think twice about dissin' me
but that's a mistake with tha syndicate you shoudn't mess
i hope those punk reporters wear vests

personal
take that personal


now the words i speak to some may sound radical
but i'll explain it's simply mathematical
you diss i diss this is creates an equal
you reply to my diss this is called a sequel
i reply to your diss this is called a battle
not intelligent not very adult
so i don't battle i just put heads out
a straight line is always the direct route
i write lyrics clear to leave no doubt
don't even have to say who i'm speakin' about
you know who you are you just jealous
'cause you hear my records are million sellers
try to say i'm wack out on the streets

see me at a jam and catch vapors

it's like walkin' barefoot over broken glass
it's like jumpin' rope on a razor blade
all lightning-quick decisions are made
lifestyle plush
females rush
this high profile personality who earns his pay illegally
professional liar
schoolboys admire
young girls desire
very few live to retire
cash flow extreme
dress code supreme
vocabulary obscene
definition-street player -- you know what i mean

the high rollers
the high rollers

people of the city stop foolin' yourself
crime rules the streets -- who the hell else?
all the police have gone out to play
because for enough cold cash they'll look the other way
just look at the cars as they go by
benz ferraris trucks up high
beepers connecting players to big-time deals
with all of this technology who needs to steal?
just live a life of leisure every night and day
and you're livin' proof that crime does pay
your life is dangerous and reckless
you eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
you're a titan of the nuclear age
your muscles flex with a uzi or 12-gauge
and you love the game that's why you boast
because you're high priced high speed high post

you're a high roller

high rollers

when i say high rollers i mean the best
forget the half-steppers eject the rest
because these high ranked officials of our city streets
make millions all triggered by electric beeps
they dress in diamonds and rope chains
they got the blood of scarface runnin' through their veins
silk shirts leather suits hair always fresh
eelskin boots large hearts though their sizes vary
bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry
cruisin' in their 500 benz sedan
with their systems peaked out rockin' pusher man
yes their fashion's high and hard to beat
they buy their gucci from gucci's not the swapmeet
eat very well much clientele
and whatever you need they probably sell

the high rollers
the high rollers

oh yes i'm here to tell you females also roll
drive the same cars sometimes wear more gold
cold as an igloo or hot as a flame
they'll shake ya break ya and you won't know their name
gangsters to the max all narks will be taxed
these girls drive ferraris not cadillacs
respect is demanded most men don't understand it
till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed
they're junkies for fun love life on the run
and if things get hot they will pull a gun
prey on the lame no shame to the game
and they all seek power -- fuck the fame

the high rollers
the high rollers

now radio stations probably won't play
this record because of the things i say
they'll say i'm glamorizing the hustlin' hood
and a record like this can do no good
but i'm not here to tell ya right or wrong
i don't know which side of the law you belong
yes the game has flash but sometimes hurts
behind any mistake hard times lurks
and jail's not your only problem though it may seem
you just may die by a barrage from an m-16
but to each his own choose the mobile phone
the tailored suit the luxury home
you'll never get caught 'cause you got nerves of ice
and you're much smarter than those crooks on miami vice
 right?
you wanna be a high roller

i ain't here for your gold bro
all i want is the show
this is grand larceny

this is grand larceny x3

i lay low for a show and then i go
steal the motherfucker then we count the dough
it's kinda like robbin' but it's legally done
and now days if it ain't legal i don't fuck around
i get a thrill when i ill and a jam is filled
with 10000 screamin' people now that's the pill
who's gonna dog the set? the ice will
and once i'm in effect it's overkill
kinda like a hold-upall the tickets sold up
and then the black stretch limo cold rolls up
and then the posse breaks high off the cold duck
and then i set the mic to show destruct
even if we open up it don't mean nothing
i rock the rhymese does the cuttin'
call it shownappin' i take a hostage a night
do shit and break out on the next flight
this is grand larceny

you can fight all night but you'll still get jacked
by the show stealer crime rhyme dealer

rob a bank
but now we steal shows the cops say thanks
breathe easy 'cause the syndicate deep

just give me a beat give me a stage to stand on
i know that none y'all ever planned on
a dude from la who could rock shit this way
have his record go gold with no radio play
but it happened the ice is rappin'
just listen to my fans that are clappin'
or come to my showsit in the front row
and watch me steal the motherfucker before your ass can say ho
i'm like a time bomb but i'm a rhyme bomb
spray the whole audience with napalm
or something just as hot i'll bust a rhyme why not?
rap hittin' so hard you'll think you shot
i'll take a show and abduct it
stone cold house it and if it gets wild
with gasoline i'll douse it
set it ablaze and then i'll stomp it out
many burnt emcees know what i'm talkin' about
this is grand larceny

promoters on my tail now
'cause they billed me low
here i am 'bout to steal another show
so they turn my mic down
fuck up my audio sound
but too late we just dogged another town
rappin' like a mac 10 as soon as i begin
the only way to stop the stealin'
is throw me in the pen
but that will never happen
'cause i'm just cool rappin'
my larceny is legal so sorry captain
i would never steal a rap
but i'll steal a show in a minute
it's as simple as that
an interstate crook my pistol's my rhyme book
any show that i'm on is a show that's took
better watch my left hook or your jaw will get shook
if my posse gets mad it's best you book

threw on my dope silk suit brushed off my suede bally's
threw on enough gold for any girl's pleasure
left a pound and a half of that shit still in the dresser
i slapped a clip in my nine threw a clip in my sock
hit three grand up off the dresser it was ten on the dot
now my beeper started beepin i threw that shit in the sink
i didn't need it no more i had more money than prince
see i was quittin the game and tonight was my fling
you see on the streets they're players but only one king
now that's the title i held but the game is real fast
you gotta get in and get out if you expectin to last
now my homeboy evil was downstairs chillin' in his brand new benz
i had many adversaries but very few close friends
we broke to the set e parked the car on the grass
high-signin was his trademark and he did it with class
hit the door like two titans the whole jam stopped to stare
and as we walked through the crowd they threw bills in the air
i spied my man jazz maxin out with two stone cold freaks
yo what's up ice you rich now man you too good to speak?
now jazz was a player from the east coast the bronx
he was known to be hard on the women and a brother he'd stomp
smack a bitch in a minute some say just for fun
and he was known for his chrome-plated pearl-handled gun
yo ice you my brother and i love you and all
but what's up with that six g's you owe me man
'member when your boys took that fall?
and i posted the bail cause yo ass was locked up
evil gave jazz ten g's and jazz shut the fuck up
just then i saw donald-d hit the front door
more gold than a aztec black leather he wore
hoes grabbed for they niggaz when d hit the set
'cause what donald-d wanted is what donald-d'd get
donald's eyes hit mine and a smile crossed his face
then a light hit his ring and blinded the whole goddamn place
yo ice you the coolest and evil you mean
but i got the fliest new shit rollin' off gasoline
everyone in the party moved quickly outside
to see donald-d's ultimate superfly ride
it was black it was low cost twice that of my porsche
a testarossa ferrari - convertable of course
it purred like a jet yo man i bought it with cash
it had 'donald-d' written in gold on the dash
then out of nowhere came a shot across the street
i felt pain in my chest and my knees got weak
there was blood on my hands and i fell to the ground
and all i could hear was yo ice is down
somebody had shot me that night that i quit
the night that i ended all this hustlin playin' shit
it's ironic ain't it the night i retired
would be the same night that my whole life expired",1

in and out of fantasies on how large we can get
coolin in rocks and benzes with the ground effect kits
i wanted black e was on the two-tone

smoke everywhere oh just what we needed
on the way to shop our demo and the car overheated
feelin' real low low enough to die
holdin' up traffic on the fdr drive
we had to play ourselves in the fresh dipped gear

we was walkin' and got dissed twice today
then we stopped at 1974 broadway

and p had juice from mr virgo simms
he played the tape and we started to laugh
played ?if it was sock? and they swoop and backstab
people start to smile inside we buckwhylin
sayin' this all started back from freestylin

but me and p was like yo e where do we sign?

yo at a hip-hop club was a girl i met
she was hot you can bet her body dripped with sweat
i kicked it to her and her name was kim
she said let's jet because she was ready for the jim
browski i doubt thee e would front
so like a real stunt i rolled the blunt
she was ready i could see in her face
she said let's jet we went back to her place
it was fat she had a dope crib
she offered food like some barbucue ribs
i said no thank you not now honey
how about some drink yes some gin rummy
after that come here and sit down
we put on tender roni by mister bobbi brown
we waste no time it was time to do it
put on some james brown so we can get into it
no kinky stuff like ropes or handcuffs
but when you love me please don't be ruff
i said listen i'll be gentle i'll be very gentle
when i'm loving yoooouuu when i'm loving yoooouuu
so i dipped i abandoned ship
threw in the anchor like on the boat tip
that's what i get for trying to be a lover
but never judge a book by the damm cover
i'm not dissing but i don't like fishing
and next time i want to know who i'm kissing
you can call me gay or a tutti-frutti
but i won't touch it until i know who's booty

parrish smith
well i was maxin one day just minding my own
talking to e-double on my car cellular phone
when i seen this fly girl clocking her looks were temptating
the look in her eye was the look of infatuation
so i put my car in park turned my system down
i said excuse me are you new in town
she said it's funny you asked i just got here today
i said yo you need a lift because i'm going that way
she said my mother always told me not to ride with strangers
if i did than my life would be in danger
i said yeah that's true but i'm not you're everyday swinger
to tell you the truth i'm a well known singer
plus i was cold coolin
40 dawn in lap
wings on my fingers from my fisherman hat
she got in and said yo i never done this before
i had to play my cards right to get my foot in the door
she got and she said you a medical doctor?
i said close but no cigar i'm the microphone doctor
who performs open surgery on mc's that are willing
except to try same them i try to kill them
she said ooh that sounds exciting please tell me more
you mean how we heinz and clock the g's or more
we got to her house and her moms wasn't home
as we went to the room i sparked up the homegrown
i was with it felling nice from old e
ready to get busy and wax a cold booty
we got to her it was time to max
pulled out the jimhat and strapped the bozak
i hit the lights and next was the sack
we started doing it it was hard to produce
because the booty was cold kickin like they call me bruce
i had to cover my nose not to ruin the mood
because i know i wasn't fishing but i smelled seafood
smelled like shrimp or lobster or tuna of the sea
and it wasn't worth catching the a-the i-the d-to the s-oh yes
the s is for safe sex
and as i glanced at the door you that move was next
but she pulled me close and said let's get loose
and out of nowhere i yelled baby did you do
she said no p 'cause i'm not a swinger
i couldn't buy that as i smelled my forefinger
i was playing myself plus my style was crampped
i grabbed my keys and coat and md broke camp
and as i walked to the door the girl got moody
i looked her eye to eye and said who's booty",1

erick sermon

open sesame and let down the main gate

before you scream epmd you should wait

i roll with a posse can you try to stop me

also yo your brothers tried to pop me

on the sneak tip without me knowin'

so i keep goin' and my rhymes keep flowin

on and on and i don't quit

i get pushed to the limit and yo that's it

step by step i put an end to your fun

'cause i'm the chosen one yes me my son

a young kid from the ghetto a kiddie from the city

i don't feel sorrow and i have no pity

to run up on you and wax plus tax

your gold your money and from your eyes your contacts

then flex over a hop skip and a jump

to the next town to go punk a chump

mc's try to diss me and try to bust caps

i'm not havin' it and that means no haps jack

so get the bozack and lay off the crack cause that's wack

this is the big payback







parrish smith

as i go and flow to a different type of tempo

why md? c'mon e cause p keep it simple

plus i'm strikin like lightnin throwin' blows like tyson

slayin mc's on the q-t sorta like a sniper

so if a sucker don't like me the feelin' is mutual

i tune my rhyme to a low rpm then shift to neutral

and crack a 40 what kind of olde e

to slay an mc how on the q-t

so what's your name boy? c'mon e you know it's md

now while i'm wreckin he's checkin' all the bodies that's left and

a pile behind the stage the p is like steppin

off from the scenes i see lights and si-rens

witness everywhere but no one seen a thing

when cops ask questions my description is vague

no answers at all just bodies behind the stage

one witness yells out that he was dressed in black

stupid dookie link with a fisherman hat

when five-ohs ask how he fleed from the spot?

in a black sports car i think it was an iroc

but the windows were tinted and we couldn't get a look

why? there was smoke from the rubber he cooked

the big payback







erick sermon

no rome-et-oh or juliette romance story

just epmd the fame and the glory

the rappin' technique somethin' like fencin

dangerous it keep you in suspense

and you have to be cool and plus have stamina

'cause if you don't i'm gonna end up stabbin ya

in your guts from the razor cuts

and i'ma stick and pick until your mind goes nuts

it might sound gross or make your stomach bubble

but don't ever ever ever mess with e double

i'm like jumpin' jack flash a spy with an eye

i do no stunts and i'm not the fall guy

i'm just the e the r-i-c-k that's all

say some check one-twos and some yes yes y'alls

i'm the man of the hour too sweet to be sour

so what you sayin' e? i got soul power

so dig it as i kick it keep your eyes open

cause a brother like me is always scopin

in fact you should pack because i cut no slack

it's like that this is the big payback







parrish smith

if rappin' was a tribe i'd be the chief commanche

hat fat link chunky rings nuttin fancy

so saddle up mc's and off we go

it's not a rodeo but i carry a lasso

'cause i'm back from vacation cause sucker kept slippin

rappin' off-beat plus they tune wasn't hittin

don't wanna claim a style on the m-i-c

but i can go state to state cold rippin shows with e

cause whether maxin or relaxin waxin or taxin

never step to a show without packin

my partners mr smith and mr wessun

so nothin' moves funny at the rappin' session

i'm strictly biz and knuckles no time for laugh or chuckles

i drop clear lyrics while your bass sound muffled

you sniff blow? hell no and still flow and say dough

more or less do a show nah

the only high i get is when my fans yell hoe

so get the bo-zack 'cause we're back to hack

here to let you know that it's the big payback",1

people gather round listen to flow
yo so i can prove that i'm the true solo
too many suckers have bit my name in vain
punk rappers thought i was sleepin' but solo came
to so many places other rappers faces
that called theirself solo i made 'em erase it
i'm solo no name lender or pretender
yo i am the solo the on-ly solo contender
duck mc's grab my name and bit it boldly
put it behind they name and ate this up like ravioli
i heard on kiss with red alert and chuck
a rapper said he went solo i said what the fuck??
my man came over and said yo i thought we heard you
joke's on you you heard a bitin ass crew
they bit my name i want it back and it's a fact
yo pmd tell 'em [damn you shouldn'ta did that]
now for the record what do i stand for
one lonely rapper on the stage who gets one single applause
give me a break my brother
my name stands for kevin self organization left others
my name's no game for those who claim to use my name
in vain cause their name sounds plain
i remain the same my flow of style won't change yo
the name of the game is for the real solo to explain
i don't know was where you ran or came
i know your vein i hate your name
you're ashamed playin' the game that drove you insane
that walk around puddles snow and the rain
with a cane nothin' to gain but shame

you wanna know why i'll tell you why
because they can't stand the soght of the jungle eye
they never fight or fuss they never curse or cuss
they just stand on the side and stare at us
they get out of line i put 'em on a vine
and give 'em one big push for all mankind
there ain't nuttin to it i just go head and do it
and lay down the jungle sound and run right through it
and when i'm on the mic i never stutter or stumble
'cause i'm a jungle brother straight out the jungle

cool and quiet but quick to start up a riot
i write the rhyme bums assist to bite it
i wear no gold around my neck just black medallions
and sold the home of true black stallions

struggle struggle just to stay alive
'cause inside the jungle either you do or you die
you got to be aware you got to have the jungle eye
take it from a brother who knows my friend
the animals the cannibals will do you in
cut your throat cut your throat stab you in the back
the untamed animal just don't know how to act
it's unbelievable unbelievable uncivilized ci-civilized
and now i'm starting to realize
danger in the jungle the jungle means danger danger
tension intense hearts filled wit anger anger
men killing men just because of one's color
in this lifetime i've seen nothing dumber

dealing 12 to 12 day into evening
i wonder how you continue to be grieving
your meal is made and it's time to chill
you buy the black mercedes benz with the gold to the grill
cruisin' up the ave while your friends get jealous
you find out you quickly get restless
you buy a gun it doesn't help but hurt you
because your so-called friend rattled on you
you're in the pen serving 10 to 20
your boy snatched your girl and put use to your money
you're out for teen but what does it mean?

my blood brother is bleeding it's a cryin' shame
out on the street tryin' to play the game
formally an in-mate straight from upstate
can't stop him now 'cause you see it's just too late
he's on the run and he's got a gun
stay out his way unless you want some
see he's gettin' older a bit more bolder
got his name written up in the 5-0 folder
a big christmas list of all the crime's he's committed
he says he didn't do it but we know he did it
summons his lawyers fingerprints bung shots
lookin' for my brother yo he's at the drug spots
livin' off that cheap chinese food
he says he only bumps the people when he's in the mood
runnin' 'round with his crews and his 2-2's
i saw him last night in the prime time news
shot and killed by a
his birth to the earth was a big mistake

now history was not my favourite subject
i used to flip through the pages and get upset
seein' little of black and too much of the other
they tried to brainwash you picture that a jungle brother

somethin' was wrong and i knew it all along

and most of all don't play with other people's wives

they fought back with civil rights

on the streets or on tv
segregation was the king
vietnam was full in swing
martin luther had to shout
let's get out get out get out
the situation sort of changed
but what really makes matters strange
is our foe is well disguised
we don't know where our fate lies
still and all we cannot lack
the fact that black is black is black

black is black is black is black
black is black is black is black

my light complexion has no meaning

wake up wake up wake up wake up
there's no time for us to break up
black is black not blue or purple
being black is like a circle
round and round we all will go
where we end up i don't know
listen to me if you will
your fantasies will get you killed
reality is what is real
reality is black is black
i try try to tell my people
we all are one created equal
before we master we must plan
is that so hard to understand?
today's the day we get together
to try to change and make things better
if not where will we be tomorrow?
drowning in the pool of sorrow
daylight shines but still few see
that we must fight for unity
in a picture that's fixed as black and white
why's it both that have to fight?

you haunt me and taunt me because my name is worth money
i give you some love and now you seem to act funny

that you could not resist when i threw you the gift?
let's do this not just to say we did it 'cause i'm committed
girl he's committed to do you
now you had me pictured as the man of your dreams
but everything good ain't as good as it seems
i might love you and leave you or tease you then please you
but girl you're just too good for me to try to scheeze you
the first day i met you i felt as though i knew you
that's why i told you upfront that i was gonna do you

for summer two weeks i was got to move
while i'm getting paid she's singing the blues
in a way i'm wrong and in a way i'm right
it's a part of making money for my dinner at night
i tried to tell her she's

i want to be your hero
i want to be your man
i want to love you every moment i can
i want to take you back to the motherland
and listen to the sounds of a steel-drum band
climb up a tree just you and me
'cause that's the way that i want it to be
feel the breeze put your mind at ease
see the pretty birds and the chimpanzees
after that we'd step down to my hut
and together we'd split up a coconut
watch the sun set watch the moon rise

i just lay back and let the big beat lead me
i never work a day in my life
single jungle brother no kids no wife
100000 rhymes from one band that's many
but back where i come from they ain't worth a penny
you've got a lot of talent but you fail to see
you paid for yours i got mine for free

play in the rain and don't get wet
walk through the desert and don't even sweat
play in the snow and don't get cold
i'm just a cool young brother who looks kinda old
run around the word schoolin' the sound
if i commit a crime i get caught i slide
i've got ladies uptown and money on the floor
there's not a thing in the world that i'm askin' for

i had it all spread out even one next door
i had it like that so what ya askin' for?
4 to 5 you see was my minimum
and every day i used to go and get with 'em
one for every hour on the hour
one on the way while i was in the shower
it sounds kinda crazy it sounds kinda bold

so you see it got to a point where they didn't care
they didn't wanna give me up so they agreed to share

g yeah
a one big scratch here we go

afrika

well i'm a sure shot shooter and i'm the big shot
the big shot yes the biggest and i know i'm hot
say i'm the baddest just the baddest and i'm on the top
sucker mc's try to stop me but i won't stop
as i adjust and discuss all the rhymes i bust
i leave 'em all in the dust when i start the thrust
they try to catch me on the mic but i'm hard to chase
i'm the ace in the place kickin' rhymes in your face
i'm outright outstanding outrageous i'm smokin'
never play on the mic no jivin' no jokin
not a double-talker so i don't double-talk
ladies clock finger-pop to the rhythm of a hawk
but i ignore the temptation avoid the sensation
reputation's at stake but i won't break
i just chill ill let loose all my skill
i make a list of all the ladies that my skill will thrill

mike g

now my tasty technique tantalises your taste
as my rhymes rock and roll right through this place
i never fade away for forfeit or fess
and my beat is a beat bound to be best
clowns craze and chase me 'cause i'm so cool
as i ridicule the rule and fool the fool
ignite the party excite the crowd
i'll make the quietest person wanna go and get loud
i'll make the hot get hotter when i start to rap
and my reward for goin' off is to hear people clap
i'm a monster for music and my means are to move
guys and gals'll get gray when it's time to groove
i'm a sexy sucker but the mind is sane
having nothing to lose but only goals to gain
by my side i'm supplied with the best of the best
sammy b and shazam which means there's no contest

afrika

well i'm an mc debator rhyme regulator
cool creator rapper not a raper
a damn good fighter party highlighter
lady exciter writer not a biter
suckers lookin' to me say what you think they see?
they see a fresh fantastic fly funky mc
they try to study my style use and abuse it for a while
till i take 'em to court and have 'em put on trial
i let mike g judge 'em put 'em on the case
sammy b you be my lawyer to put 'em to disgrace
you see i never have to worry 'cause they both got my back
sammy b for the fader mike g for the rap

mike g

the more suckers i burn the better suckers will learn
that mike g is takin' his turn to earn
havin' the time the rhyme i'm gonna get mine
and it pushes the thought of suckers further out of my mind
'cause as i rhyme to my peep suckers smoke the cheap
and butlers take down my orders from the words that i speak
because i'm strong like a horse and loud like thunder
you mess with me you'll be 60 feet under
in a jungle with a force on a straight-forward course
and if you don't join the jungle you should feel remorse

break

afrika

ah yeah
yes yes y'all and you don't stop
you keep on to the break of dawn
you keep on to the break of dawn
you gotta be on time when you bust your rhyme
and you can't be wack when you rap the rap
you gotta get on the mic and do your best
for the people in the north south east and west
like you can't judge a book by it's cover
if you listen you will learn from a jungle brother
like that y'all and you don't stop
you keep on to the early morn
hey yo i'm outta here",1

so i let him go i let him run along run along
i write rhymes like i come from new york city
my dj spin the music down to the nitty gritty
when the downstairs funky five days a week
searching and seeking for the baby bam beat
the afrikan rap that comes from within us
brothers heard about it now they wish they could've been us
we did an album with no problem
no we working on another with another jungle brother

so q-tip when the light turns green
grab your bone and show them what i mean

my bone is grabbed this is what i mean
i brag a grab and here's the scene
q-tip q-tip from a tribe called quest
saw the jungle brother's album oh yes
so get the ducats it's coming out soon

get wise or get something cause your going to want to
lamp after you hear from me

move out the way when i'm comin' through the door

step back it ain't that type of party
no reply if you ain't somebody
get out my face don't wanna hear no more

all in the way just little obstacles
chew 'em up spit 'em out just like popsicles

to the beat can i get an amen brother?
liked that rhyme? well here goes another

hold up hold up hold up check it out before we go any further we
gotta announce who we are i am dj k-rock and this is my homegirl mc
lyte kick it for 'em

we had to pause for station identification
now ya know my name here's some more information
well let's see what you wanna know about me?
mc l-y-t-e
the queen nah that's too corny
the sexy nah that gets the guys too horny
the best now that sounds conceited
but what is true is true so it has to be repeated
the best is lyte when i'm on the mic
and mc's look straight ahead 'cause this pitch'll make your neck tired


and i say loosen up and relax
the fiction you been livin' imma fill with facts
right now

mc lyte dj k-rock name of the group is me and my dj kickin' it
live in '88 do it

i am woman hear me roar
comin' out fresher and flyer than i did before
that's right i'm well respected
don't get stupid i'm well protected
if ya wanna battle i'm well prepared
me and k-rock are far from scared you know what
we're brave livin' in a cave of gold
waitin' for the misbehaved to get bold
but as i look around so far so good
mc's behaving just like they should
hands are folded no whispering or passing notes
all attention to me ya have to devote
i'm like a teacher but then again not quite
'cause a teacher's salary i'm makin' a night
on the mic rhymes witty and bright
maybe that's why the name is lyte
yo bust it imma end it right here
dj k-rock you end it over there",1
3,"i may come on strong but that's what you like
you like a female mc who can handle the mike
how do i know? because you told me so
you instantly prefer a pro to supervise the show
so that's why i'm here don't mean to make a case of it
this rap here well it's just for the taste of it
i write the rap to make the whole world sing
and i'm the type of female well i like to swing

mc lyte likes swingin'

party people in the place since you started the case
of a demonstration i need concentration
so you can make a full examination
then you will agree that i'm the best mc
and so is my deejay on the tables rock
this is the best jam that you could get
the rap by lyte and the beat by stetsa
beat by stetsa beat by stetsa
never turn it down 'cause it's what you requested
any mike i hold you know the big man pressed it
sole believer in the rap i say
you believe it too that's why you never walk away
you like the way i do it you like my style
study me like a book cause you know i'm worth your while
expressions on my face show you just how i feel
add a rap to my gestures now you know the deal

mc lyte likes swingin'

cause yo i am the best and that i'll boast
sit down and be the guest and i'll be the host
it's wack to those that know and those that do not
like 'coke is it' i hit the spot
like 'good vibrations' i'm like sunkist
the rap is smooth 'cause it's sealed with chapstick
not gonna say that i been rappin' since the day of birth
but i've acquired the knowledge like ms butterworth
ask me what's important i tell you time and effort
ask me how i do it it's lyte's ??? method
yeah lyte is good bud light's good for ya
i'm exciting just like toyota",1

it goes to my head as just chit chatter
you may take this egostistical or just or worry free
but what you say i take none of it seriously
and even if i did i wouldn't tell you so
i'd let you pretend to read me

and then you'll know
'cause i hate when one attempts to analyze
that i despize those who even try
to look into my eyes to see what i am

thinking
that dream is over you gotta sink it
and i tell all of you like i told all of them
what you say to me is just paper thin word

i'm not the kind of girl to try to play a man out
i take the money and the gear and then break the hell out
no that's not my strategy not the game i play
i admit i play game but it's not done that way
truly when i get involved i give it my heart
i mean my mind my soul my body i mean every part
but if it doesn't work out yo it just doesn't
it wasn't meant to be you know it just wasn't
so i treat all of you like i treat all of them
and what you say to me is

still paper thin
in one ear and right out the other
hurt is mumbo jumbo eeeish lover
i don't pay attention
i don't concentrate
you ain't got the bait that it takes to hook this
a-hah a-hah a-hah
sucker you missed i put feelings aside i know who i am
my name is lyte is your name sam?
'cause if it is step off grab your coat and get lost
wrap your scarf around your throat and go back and catch a rope
and hit the road sam don't you come back
no more no more no more no more
hit the road sam don't you come back no more

so now i take precaution when choosing my mate
i do not touch until the third or fourth date
then maybe we'll kiss on the fifth or sixth
time to be me mmmuaah kiss
cause a date without a kiss is so incomplete
and then maybe i'll let you play with my feet
you could suck the big toe and play with the middle
it's so simple unlike a riddle
it's as easy as counting to 1-2-3
in other terms letters l-y-t-e
i'll tell you you you and all of you
in the back and in the middle in the front
yo that's it paper thin word up
lyte checkin' out
special dedication to my dj k-rock in the place to be",1
6,"mc lyte
from now on it's not mc lyte
listen up everybody it's lyte thee mc

tackling anyone who tries to stop me
from fulfilling the ultimate the ultimate goal
suckers takin' up room on the microphone
i do pay for crowds move over stop stalkin me
i feel like i'm drownin and fans are just stompin me
bigfoot should we buck the uncivilized
but i'm so tame i don't mean to criticize
but why you sweatin we don't go together
especially if i'm muggy in the rainy kind of weather

chorus chop up this phrase
listen up everybody it's lyte thee mc

mc lyte
competition i take it as good for the soul
pull back the microphone let my arms unfold
release all the anger all the aggravation
convert it into words just sorta like a conversation
i am the talker you're just the listener
talk and i'll ignore you is it that offensive to you?
the problem is you can't understand
the logic in my rap you can't comprehend so you
merely step aside what all call the weak
but you'll also step aside when i'm comin' down the street
you'll give me lots of room to whistle and walk
and then everything is silent just in case i wanna talk
but i i never do small talk i like to hear
other girls rap and you say that i'm whack~?
comin' from a female that is totally dedicated
every rhyme i say you ought to appreciate it
and if not i'll tell you like i told my neighbor dana betty
what? you ain't ready
for a fly female emcee you just ain't ready

mc lyte
competition i take it as food for the mind
past experience from the future is the best kind
of advice that you could ever receive from another
whether it's a stranger or your night time lover
sorry silly rabbits trix are for kids
brings back memories of the things that i did
played jokes on suckers just for fun
but now i'm much older those days are done
everything is business forget about games
you see cause once i'm finished you're gonna know my name
is lyte and in brooklyn brooklyn's where i'm chillin'
better known as the emcee villain
no i'm not good but i'm not bad either
come into your life it can't get no liver

mc lyte
so now competition is taken out of my vocabulary
i don't vary i bury
steppin up is like diggin your grave
so sucker emcees you ought to save
all the mess you be talkin' meanwhile hawkin
when i'm on the stage audience watchin
suckers in the corners just keep on clockin
the way i hold the mic the stance i use
the rhymes i recite and the beat i choose
but it's not your fault because you don't know better
you see green i wear you go buy the same sweater
you look me up and down sight the jeans name brand
you go to macy's and for hours you stand
on line just to buy what you saw lyte wearin
don't try to lie homegirl i caught you starin'
cause yo the beat is dope and the rhymes are kickin
i'm the chickenhawk and you are the chicken",1
7,"i used to be in love with this guy named sam
i don't know why 'cause he had the head like that of a clam
but you couldn't tell me nothin' cause sam was number one
cause to me oh my gosh he was one in a million
i shoulda knew the consequences right from the start
that he'd use me for my money and then break my heart
but like a fool in love i fell for his game
but i got mine so i show no shame
in empire winked his eye and then he kept walkin'
and all of those who live in brooklyn know just what i'm talkin'
the roller disco where we all used to go
just to have some fun back in 1981
you know the place empire boulevard
is where i first saw the nigga and he tried to play hard
but i knew the deal 'cause i knew his brother jerry
and sam he just broke up with his girlfriend terry
so jerry introduced sam and i that night
he said hello my name is sam i said hi my name is lyte
we dipped and we dapped and we chit and we chat
about this and that from sneakers to hats
he said look i'm in the mood for love
simply because you're near me
let's go to my house lay back and get nice
watch television reunite on ice
i said slow down i know you wanna shake me down
but i'm not one of the girls to go rippin around

just like a test
ju-just like a test
ju-just like a test
i cram to understand you

next month i finally went to his house
i walked into the door there was a girl on the couch
i said who's the frog the bump on the log?
you chump you punk how could you do me wrong?
singing sad songs about your love is so strong
you said wait lyte you're confused the girl is my cousin
your brother agreed but later she said that she wasn't

just like a test
ju-just like a test
ju-just like a test
i cram to understand u

forgotten next month we went to the deuce
well i thought it kinda strange cause you had lots of juice
you knew the dopes the pushers the addicts everybody
asked ya how you met em said you met 'em at a party
then these girls tried to tell me you were sellin the stuff
i said it's not your business so shut the fuck up
they said okay lyte think what you wanna think
but it's gon' be some shit when your man becomes a -
i said look to bust a move i don't even know you
to put it lyte i really don't care to
they kinda got mad and sort of offended
they said we only lookin' out for yo best interest
i said thanks but no thanks in an aggravated tone
when i wanna find out i find out on my own

just like a test
ju-just like a test
ju-just like a test
i cram to understand u

then my cousin said she saw you with this lady named c
well i'm clawin my thoughts i wonder who she could be
you're spending all your time with her and not a second with me
they say you spend your money on her and you're with her night and day
her name starts with a c and it ends with a k
i strain my brain lookin' for a name to fit this spellin
but i just couldn't do it cause my heart kept yellin'
burning begging for affection from you sam
but just like a test i cram to understand you
thought i knew you well enough to call you a man
but just like a test
ju-just like a test
ju-just like a test
i cram to understand you

then it came a time you started looking kinda thin
i asked you why you said exercise tryina stay slim
i bought it even though i knew it was a lie
cause it really didn't matter you were still lookin' fly
but oh no oh no you started askin me for money
butter me up beg me and call me your honey
so i gave you 2 yards and then i gave you one more
you picked up your jacket and you flew out the door
you came back an hour later and you asked me for a 10
i said i only got a 20 you said give me that then
i said nope i'll tell you now you better stop slobbin
find you a job or you better start robbin
so i stepped off with a giant step
picked up my belongings and i just left
and now i see you in empire every sunday
juicin the girls up for some money and a lay
but every time i see you doin' it i just ruin it
tell 'em how ya on crack smoke sniff and chewin it
and as for this girl miss c oh well
i was shocked as hell when i heard samuel
when your homeboys told me i almost went wack
that the girl you was addicted to her name was crack",1

so here's the microphone let's see what you can do
so i took the microphone and i threw it to the ground
'cause i need no assist when it comes to gettin' down

she knew to confront me was truly a mistake

9,"this is lyte and i'm just here to say
that i choose to express my feelings this way
always alone either with a microphone
or just plainly emphasize the tone
of my voice cause yo i know i'm your choice
so when i am speaking show your gratitude
while i am teaching i have no attitude
i'm just here to get the job totally done
85% work 15% fun
sometimes i admit i get so excited
rhyme for rhyme i just can't fight it
can't stop the flow it's just too persistent",1
0,"a child was born in the east one day
moved to the west coast after his parents passed away
never understood his fascination with rhymes or beats
in poetry he was considered elite
became a young gangster in the streets of la
lost connections with his true roots far away
but no matter the job or crime
he never lost his hardcore obsession to rhyme
new york's hip hop movement broke loose
dj's cut records raps had the juice
since busting rhymes was his natural thing
he was crowned the west coast mc king
but after his inauguration there was a rush
of wack rappers with one intention to crush
this master rapper and take his throne
a simple job he had no crew he stood all alone
assassins came in groups of one through five
with raps no mortal mc could survive
but he showed no mercy he rapped blood thirsty
battling from friday on through to thursday
never losin a bout never ending in doubt
every confrontation ko knock out
on his never ending journey to the top
the la player mc ice-t

verse one
magnificent rhymer i'm the ill beat designer
if they ask you if i'm def don't front and say kinda
merciless meticulous so fresh it's ridiculous
i'm raised in the heart of los a-n-g-e-l-e-s

king word connector the vocal projector
your girl tried to jock me i had to reject her
always adventurous voice some say is sensuous
now i'm on the mic so i think i better mention this

i don't like gucci fila louie or fendi
those are fads and i ain't trendy
but whether your name's lucy terry laura or cindy
ice got beef and this ain't wendy's

bust a move while i'm talkin'
sucker rappers i be stalkin'
when they see me on the street with my homeboy walkin'
they slow down turn around and ask was that ice?

then they see me cold countin' my cash
rhyme pays

verse two
moves must be busted girls can't be trusted
i looked at your lady and i was disgusted
came into the party just to rock the place
and your big zombie lookin' freak still won't get out of my face

i don't mean to diss her but do you kiss her?
look at her lips she got them crazy blisters
body that smells like the new york mets
arm pits all nappy packed full of sweat

i hope this something that you never forget
tie that freak outside next time you come in the set
because my jams be crazy packed with all fly ladies
i'm talkin' def girlies and i don't mean maybe

the way i rhyme no one will ever slay me
and i ain't lyin' rhyme do pay me

rhyme pays

verse three
i'm notorious i'm infamous like a snake i'm venomous
for those who may diss i think you should consider this
i can make a rhyme complicated as a puzzle
dangerous and as violent as a pit bull in a muzzle

but this record is for radio s-t-e-r-e-o
it not to be banned or for some underground mix show
my hearts in my pen every time i begin
sometimes my lyrics go crazy and i just can't control 'em my friend

i try to edit what i'm rappin' about
but i can't write polite my anger just jumps out
perpetrators in the business claim their hard as hell
talkin' that gangster shit know'n they're soft as jell-

oh i better chill out before i ill out
and my negative potential just might spill out
and then this record won't be gettin' played
i'll save that rap for another day

-rhyme pays-

verse four
the front stage area goes into hysteria
as i start to rhyme and unleash my criteria
of what is to come during the beat of the drum
and evil agitates the records with the use of his thumb

using his intricate moves the record stays in the groove
my boy cuts like jason it's easy to prove
that evil e is the great his cuts are real not fake
not emulated effects or a play back tape

so suckers witness your fate while evil demonstrates
i'm bout to get off this mic e dog the break - kick it

verse five
like me if ya want'a diss me if you're gonna
but my jam will still be kickin' on your neighborhood corner
as my bass is max'n out the vus on your box
there'll be no doubt within your mind whether this mc do rock

like granite i planned it so you could understand it
if someone's talkin' when i'm rhymin'
then just say damn shut up

while ice is breakin' the boy don't be fakin'
maybe they're just jealous of the dollars i'm makin'
but you're down with me you know god gifted me
black kids say i'm trech white kids say i'm nifty

spell out my name ya go i-c-e t
but right now it's time for evil e to hit me

verse six
rhyme pays buys my food every night and day
it pays my rent my bills i guess i'm doin' ok
but when i say rhyme pays i mean in different ways
cause rappin' gets a lot of kids out of the streets each day

it makes me feel real nice when someone likes the ice
or some young mc asks me for advice
but there will always be rappers who hate ice t
maybe i dogged 'em in a battle or just jealousy

inevitable situation sucker rapper frustration
i rhyme too tough to bite too intricate for notation
syllables jumble competitors crumble as they witness mic attack
and the microphone rumbles like hurricane

i maim sometimes i go insane
step toward my rap and i inflict the pain
no shame ice capital t's my name
damn there i go illin' out again

1,"6'n the morning' police at my door
fresh adidas squerk across the bathroom floor
out the back window i make a escape
don't even get a chance to grab my old school tape

mad with no music but happy 'cause i'm free
and the streets to a player is the place to be
gotta knot in my pocket weighin' at least a grand
gold on my neck my pistols close at hand

i'm a self-made monster of the city streets
remotely controlled by hard hip hop beats
but just livin' in the city is a serious task
didn't know what the cops wanted
didn't have the time to ask

-word-

seen my homeboys coolin' way out told 'em bout my mornin'
cold bugged' 'em out shot allmenn little dice until my knees got sore
kicked around some stories 'bout the night before
possed to the corner where the fly girls chill

through action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
she started actin' stupid simply would not quit
called us all punk pussies said we all weren't shit
as we walked over to here hoe continued to speak

so we beat the bitch down in the god damn street
but just livin' in the city a serious task
bitch didn't know what hit her didn't have time to ask

-word-

continued clockin' freaks with emcee posterior
rollin' in allmenn blazer with a louie interior
solid gold the ride was raw
bust allmenn left turn was on crenshaw

sean-e-sean was the driver known to give freaks hell
had a beeper goin' off like a high school bell

looked in the mirror what did we see?
fuckin' blue lights la pd
pigs searched our car their day was made
found allmenn uzi 44 and a handgranade

threw us in the county high power block
no freaks to see no beats to rock
didn't want trouble but the shit must fly
squabbled this sucker shanked' 'em in the eye

but livin' in the county is a serious task
niga didn't know what happened
didn't have time to ask

back on the streets after five and a deuce
seven years later but still had the juice
my homeboy ken gee put me up the track
told me e's rollin' villain - bj's got the sack

bruce is a giant - nat c's clockin' dough
be bop's a pimp my old freaks a hoe
the batter rams rollin' rocks are the thing
life has no meaning and money is king

then he looked at me slowely and hen had to grin
he said man you out early we thought you got ten
opened his safe kicked me down with cold cash
knew i would get busy- he didn't waste time to ask

-word-

i bought a benz with the money the rest went to clothes
went to the strip strted pimpin' the hoes
my hair had grew long on my seven year stay
and when i got it done on my shoulders it lay

hard from the joint but fly to my heart
i didn't want no trouble but the shit had to start
out with my crew some ounks got loud
shot gun blasts echoed throug the crowd

six punks hit two punks died
all casualities appiled to their side
human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
we didn't know who they were - no one had the time to ask

part two

swat team leader yelled hit the floor
reached in my pocket pulled my 44
dove across the room peeped out the window
twenty cops jumped behind a pinto
out the back door like some damn track stars
broke down an alley jumped into a car

suckers didn't even see us they musta been blind
black wire touched red the car was mine
we hadn't done nothin' but some suckers got shot
hit the first turn god damn road block

broke through the block and we did it fast
cops wouldn't shot us on sight
they wouldn't took time to ask

-word-

the rollers gave chase at a serious speed
one more conviction was all i need
this shit was for real

this was no la-di-da-di
cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
and me and my crew we were known to get ill
we carried heat for protection but not to kill

we bust a corner doin' 60 one police car spun
and all i was thinkin' was murder one
bust a move into an alley and did it right
and me and my vrew we're gone into the night

broke to my old lady's who drew me a bath
she didn't even know what happened
didn't care didn't ask

-word-

qwe made love like crazy on top of the sheets
this girlie was my worlie a natural freak
she ran her tonuge over each and every part of me
then she rocked my amadeus as i watched tv

a technican with a mission that's what she was
if there had been a crowd she would of got an applause
this girl did everything on earth to me that could be done
the she backed off and teased me so i couldn't come

then she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor
had me beggin' to stop as i was acreamin' for more
after she waxed by body she let me crash
she knew her lovin' was def
she didn't waste time to ask

-word-

up the next mornin' feelin' good as hell
sleepin' with a girlie sure beats a cell
hit the boulevard in my amg
hoe's catchin' whiplash tryin' to glimpse the t

ring on my mobile yes celluar
got to have a phone when i'm in my car
was my homeboy red some say he's insane
broke his bitch jaw for smkin' came

told me to meet him at the airporrt
said he's jumpin' bail said he just left court
caught the first thing smokin' in a serious dash
didn't know where we were going
didn't care didn't ask

-word-

fell a sleep on the plane and so did he
woke up chillin' in nyc
called up my posse when i got there
hit the latin qarter union square

rooftop devil's nest the rest we passed
back doored the palladium just for class
about 4 am we crashed the deuce
we never catch static 'cause my boys got juice

deuced it to the bronx to rest our heads
where a shoot out jumped off mine people lay dead
it sounded like it happened with a mac 10 blast
but it was 6'in the mornin'
we didn't wake up to ask

5,"ya heard the ice was rockin' ticket sales were high
bought some fresh adidas so you could look fly
broke out from your crib rushin' to get here
tripped ans stumbled almost broke your neck comin' down the stairs
jumped into your ride pushed the speed to the limit
jumped out of your car faster than you jumped in it
now you're at the jam but in for a shock
stupid big line wrapped around the block
through the walls of the hall you could hear me rhyme
methodically you schemed a way to cut in line
but when you got inside the sight straightened your curls
cause as you look around all you could see were girls

i love ladies

i think it's time that i tell the truth
i been dissin' females since my early youth
but you know that's a drag and there's no doubt
cause females are the one thing that i can't do without
female companionship is my one vice
i love to buy the girls things love to treat 'em real nice
homeboys you must admit the best part of each day
is when a beautiful lady comes walkin' your way
females possess that one commodity that no man will ever have
not that hangs around me
they got it we want it they move it and flaunt it
they shake it and sway it we'll die just to lay it
we try to suppress it until they undress it
and beg 'em to use it and cry not to lose it
no man can deny it so don't even try it

i love ladies
ladies are you with me? yeah
i love ladies
ladies are you with me? yeah
that sounds nice you know we love you ice

i'm junkie for females and that's a fact
i'm not into havin' my homeboys rubbin' my back
don't dig goin' to the movies alone
or talkin' to myself on the telephone
goin' to a disco that's packed with men
that's like tryin' to get a dance in the federal pen
walkin' through a park with a gang of the guys
and a beach full of fellas never opened my eyes
and man if females are one thing that you don't need
you better get away from me at a high rate of speed
'cause if you don't like them you must like men
and homeboy that's where our serious problems begin
because to me women are god's true gift
there's absolutely no question who i'd rather be with

i love ladies

i seen this fly girl walkin' down the street
jammin' a box rockin' to the beat
the girl looked pretty she really looked nice
so i said to myself she's got to be with the ice
walked over to her started sayin' my rhyme
she said ice you're so bad you damn near blew my mind
i kept on rappin' runnin' my mouth
the next thing i knew i was at her house
looked at her closely said for goodness sake
the girl was cut like a diamond had curves like a snake
her top half was heaven the bottom was the hell
i knew tonight that the ice was gonna rock well
but then she started talkin' mess about love and romance
until she noticed the bulge growin' in my pants
you should'a seen the girl's eyes as my body expanded
she grabbed for my leg raw sex she demanded
my knees started knockin' i tried to run
she said please don't leave ice i want you to come
this girl meant business i had no doubt
this is just about the time that the ice passed out
the next day i woke the girl was through
room still smokin' my legs black and blue
my eyes bloodshot my hair pressed straight
my knees still knockin' i knew i lost weight
she was the best y'all yes on this earth
i would'a paid a million dollars that's what it was worth
if i had got her name or number it would'a been nice
but i'm here to let you know the girl went off on the ice

i love ladies
ladies are you with me? yeah
i love ladies
ladies are you with me? yeah
that sounds nice you know we love you ice

no when it comes to partyin' the ladies know how
when i ask for a reply they always scream owww
it's the homeboys always tryin' to act real chill
sometimes it's jealous mc's mad 'cause they ain't on the bill
maybe they scared if they say ho
they might lose their cool
but i got some news for you a fool's a fool
but don't get me wrong most fellas do rock
they put their hands in the air they take the show to the top
they start rockin' with the ladies once the show begins
they don't stand lookin' stupid like some mannequins
they don't lean against the wall like they're i some trance
they did not come with no intention to party or dance
you know what? yo dead beats should just stay home
leave me my homeboys and the ladies alone

we love ladies",1
6,"sex i the morning sex at night sex in the afternoon's all right
ain't a man on earth that can stay alive
without a sex drive

sex x4

i was in a contest to rock the world
first prize was a virgin young girl
for four days i was up on the mic
all sucker mc's were on the bite
bittin' my rhymes stealin' my style
i rocked so hard it wasn't true
i won the virgin girl and her mama too

sex x4

when i'm upon the microphone
all the fly young ladies want a take me home
when the party's over take me to their house
throw me in the bed know what we're talkin' about?
then they sayice-t you are the best
i love your eyes
your things your chest
you put all my lovers to shame
i can't remember my boyfriends name
you made me feel all hot and wet
the way you move i can't forget
i came i came i came again it felt so good i told my friends
you can have my cars my jewels my wealth
i love you more than i love myself
after tonight fulfilled i'll be
no hundred men could match ice-t

sex x4

then she turn out the lights throw back the sheets
and then our two hot bodies meet
and all at once she felt the thrill
the caress of the best the ice-t chill
start with her tongue upon the back of my leg
she didn't stop till i hollered screamed and begged
then she rolled me over took me to the stage
like in the nasty book where you tore out the page

sex x4

i put it in their blouse
in their brain their little panties that their boyfriend saw
i put it in their mini skirt and up their thigh
deep deep girls i wanna make you cry
i move it in and out know what i'm talkin' about
then around your neck until you show respect
then on your cheek until i reach my peak
then in your mouth girl no joke i'll take it out
don't want to see you choke
i'll run it down your back might cause a heart attack
i'll put it in your butt until i get enough
and then i'll take it out and put it in my pants
'cause i fuck with the beat the only way to dance

7,"deuce deuce revolver was my problem solver
had a def girl really didn't wanna involve her
in the life of a gangster use to rob bankster
but now i'm locked up i'm just a punk low rankster
jail cells know me too damn well
seems like i've built on earth my own personal hell
no matter how high i climbed somehow i always fell
i guess a lot of players got this story to tell
no matter how cold you roll you simply cannot win
it's always fun in the beginning
but pain in the end

pain x4

organized crimer big trouble finder
in and out of institutions ever since i was a minor
but now i'm on the bricks deep in the mix
crime smarts searching hard for some new street tricks
i think i'll join a gang sling a little cane
put a beeper on my belt and get myself a name
fresh sneakers silk shirts24/7 work
nine to five to survive you gotta be a jerki
i clock two grand a day yet i was born to play
who me at micky dee's?it wouldn't work no way
i'm a big money haver but not the last laugher
for me infamy makes me no autographer
custody haunts my dreams nightmares of capture
paranoid of surveillance phobia of cameras
my banks bigger but so are my fears
past records proved players live limited years
but i'm unlike the rest know to be the best
fast money true wealth my eternal quest
i hustle all night long there ain't no gain in rest
12 gauge close range bloods on my chest
i looked into his face i thought he was my friend
my boy had me set up this wound would never mend
no matter who you trust you simply cannot win
it's always fun in the beginning
but it's pain in the end

pain x4

gold rope wearer neighborhood terror
can't hang around my mother 'cause she says i scare her
got a light sunburn from too much pool-side sittin'
coroless phone keeps me on 'cause there ain't no quittin'
mind's in a money mode seems like it should explode
girlies on my jammie got a female overload
young street messiah professional liar

crazy money it ain't funny suckers lovin' my jock
but there's some people at my door that didn't even knock
task force boomin' doggin' my crib out can't shout
fbi got a gun in my mouth
threw me on the floor called my girl a whore
pulled ten g's out my mattress and was lookin' for more
cracked my safe with an axe then illed out to the max
when they seem my money kickin' it in twenty g stacks
booked me on ten counts with bails of different amounts
the charges stuck like glue some that i couldn't pronounce
they threw my ass the book my life wa surely took
and then they gave my girl
ten years for hangin' out with a crook
she played the game herself fast lane quick wealth
no respect for the law or the city's health
the sweat of hustlers greed is not reserved for men
it's always fun in the beginning
but it's pain in the end

rampage on stage my crews in a rage
searched my posse found the uzi but missed the 12 gauge
maniac i'm a rhyme brainiac livin' on the edge of a razor

cold rollin' thick as a shake i'm rockin' hard as a quake
i can't live on bread and water or lobster and steak

about to unload the ammoe squeeze the trigger

they say i'm violent they should watch their tv
they say i'm brutal they should check their pd

i've been dogged out by cops shackled and socked
paid my dues to the streets took my hard knocks
disrespected by snobs damn near trampled by mobs
persecuted by squares workin' nine to five jobs
like a panther i prowl like a lion i growl
learn to see behind my back like the head of an owl
i'm the voice of the youth the prophet of truth
what i speak is really though some
may say ruthless tactics are takin' by me to awaken
people to life but i feel no fakin'
no jivin' no lyin' no frontin' no playin'
say exactly what's up understand what i'm sayin'
ban me try it you might cause a riot
what the radio won't play the underground will supply it
i'm a mc pirate that's loud not quiet
radical as they make'em make a rule i'll defy it
critics may say i'm wise some may call my words lies
i've lived more in one day than they will in their lives
but most do respect the words i inject
kick credit for realism and the truth i project
because i could bust rhymes for fun or cut mc's like a knife
but the topic i love is the drama of life
so don't diss me don't dare i feel you should care
you may think i'm soft but you're just unaware
of the wrath of the ice enraged prepare

cops hate kids kids hate cops cops kill kid's with warnin' shouts
what is crime and what in not?what is justice?i think i forgot
we buy weapons to keep us strong
reagan sends guns where they don't belong
the controversy is thick and the drag is strong
but no matter the lies we all know who's wrong
homeless sleep on the city streets
waitin' to die with nothin' to eat
while rich politicians soak their feet
in the pools at their ten million buck retreats
people hate people for color of face
no one had a choice in the race we were placed
a brother in queens was beaten and chased
murdered cold in the streets a goodamn disgrace
just because of his race his life went to waste
and no one went to jail when the court heard the case

lay it down put it down find a way to try and stop it
or change it rearrange it be a producer
don't touch the microphone because you'll always be the loser
and laughed at smirked on you don't belong
with those that perform their song on and on
and on and on and on yo let's get specific
this style is for the gifted poetically uplifted
i speak to you not at you to attack you
maybe when i'm through with this rhyme i'll get a statue
so now i ax you or tell you people literally
when it comes to rockin' funky lyrics few are better than me
down with bdp endlessly recitin' poetry
any time i'm in the street you hear my voice you know it's me
kr nope i'm not ready to say my name yet
many say they teach but this style they haven't attained yet

don't you know that it's krs-one
that comes to sing the styles that ain't sung
i rocked the party but oh gotta run
'cause only the suckers want a chance at that
to see if krs-one is really all that
instead of a rap i jap-slap all of 'em back
because the teacher that you see is not wack
i'd like to stack up all the hits that i've made
three albums a triple-layer cake
and throw it in your face you waste
pick up the pace and taste a poet from the black race
while i whip you whine you're out of touch
i'm out of time here's another rhyme

the black man's in effect jeeeeeeesus oh gosh dude oh gosh oh
yes dude yes

what's the name of that crew? bdp

and a prayer to excuse my sins
i can walk anywhere i choose
cause everybody listens to the bdp crew
we're not here for glamour or fashion
but here's the question i'm askin
why is it young black kids taught {flashin? }
they're only taught how to read write and act
it's like teachin a dog to be a cat
you don't teach white kids to be black
why is that? is it because we're the minority?
well black kids follow me
genesis chapter eleven verse ten
explains the genealogy of chem
chem was a black man in africa
if you repeat this fact they can't laugh at ya
genesis fourteen verse thirteen
abraham steps on the scene
being a descendent of chem which is a fact
means abraham too was black
abraham born in the city of a black man
called nimrod grandson of kam
kam had four sons one was named canaan
here let me do some explaining
abraham was the father of isaac
isaac was the father of jacob
jacob had twelve sons for real
and these were the children of isreal
according to genesis chapter ten
egyptains descended from {hahm kam}
six hundred years later my brother read up
moses was born in egypt
in this era black egyptians weren't right
they enslaved black isrealites
moses had to be of the black race
because he spent forty years in pharoah's place
he passed as the pharoah's grandson
so he had to look just like him
yes my brothers and sisters take this here song
yo correct the wrong
the information we get today is just wack
but ask yourself why is that?

verse two

the age of the ignorant rapper is done
knowledge reigns supreme over nearly everyone
the stereotype must be lost
that love and peace and knowledge is soft
do away with that and understand one fact
for love peace must attack
and attack real strong stronger than war
to conquer it and it's law
mental pictures stereotypes and fake history
reinforces mystery
and when mystery is reinforced
that only means that knowledge has been lost
when you know who you really are
peace and knowledge shines like a star
i'm only showin you a simple fact
it takes a nation of millions to hold us people back
which is wack but we can correct that
teach and learn what it is to be black
'cause they're teachin birds to be a cat
but ask yourself homeboy why is that?",1
2,"musty fusty yet so crystal clear
the non-commercial set is now here
brought to you by the will of positve people
k-r-s plus one equals
slammin' lyrics and beats unquestionable
the peofessional while i guess that you'll
grab the album that rocks most on the market
strong hearted with a target
--bloo-- and the target is hit
i shot the lyric then reload the clip
--bloo-- another shell hits the ground
along with the shell my opponents weak crown
--bloo bloo-- the title comes after
what a disaster listen to the laughter
your heart i capture
cause every lecture has tecture
if you're wack i say next sir
who's next 'cause i've got no time for weakness
only the teacher speaks this
dialect which gains nuff resect
which money can't buy you yet
i don't care cause boogie down productions has both
the most worldwide coast to coast
we didn't do it with the soft commercial sound
try the ghetto 'cause i refuse to let go
you see you don't understand i knew it
you got a copy i read from the blueprint

keepin' it on track
and never wack
please step back
if you speak the weak rap
'cause i alone can dis your whole pack or posse
stupid sit there and watch me
you can't stop the original with a copy
sloppy very sloppy you slouch
every time i bite you yell ouch
breakout get lost your throat is hoarse
you lost 'cause i'm dope of course
--one and two and three and four--
but that comes from years of practice
anti-slackness anti-wackness
throw on the glasses and teach the masses
very simple the question i ask is
how many mcs must get stomped
before somebody says kris has no calm
thousands both here and overseas
if you're soft i say please leave
here's the door here's your hat coat and mitt
cause here we read from the blueprint",1
3,"krs-one
again we start let me say my part
about the only guy who has some heart
it took some time for the heart to come
but it's here and everybody's in fear
crashin through the door of that whore
bringin' a end to this gold chain war
what you saw krs-one is now seeing
another fly human being
making no excuses for the losers
chain-snatchers pimps drug abusers
you don't like it but you gotta keep pushin
until somebody starts mushin
all these suckers claimin to rule the environment
nah man i ain't buyin it
you seem to think that everybody can be taught
that everyone else can be bought
but you took a short cause one guy hasn't been paid
he is the jack of spades

 d-nice scratches jack jack 

krs-one
he's a calm kind of guy courageous and loyal
but don't let the temper boil
cause just like a pot when the whistle blows
that's right boy anything goes
the crime is committed and he's right on your tail
there's no bail not thinkin' bout jail
all the ends are justified by the means
when jack's on the scene
track the movement don't lose it
'cause if he come through the back he attacks
crack cocaine cops and more fiends
who all get the same in the heat of this gold chain game
here is the aim --
destroy all the stereotypes hypes and crack pipes
we don't like criminals and crime --
but we don't pay it any mind
so here comes kung-fu joe and fly guy
slade hammer and slammer
i am a renegade teacher and scholar
if you ain't up on it you gotta
fall to the back of the line
hear this rhyme 'cause i'ma say it one more time
it's jack's theme song that krs made
it's called the jack of spades

 d-nice scratches jack jack 

krs-one
you know the jack of spades is now down with the bdp posse
if you wanna see more just watch me
man do what i do throw your hands in the air
and scream it out oh yeah oh yeah
one more time oh yeah
flash the rhyme
cool guy loud and quiet
if your head's in the way he'll fly it
don't try it cause jack of spades doesn't buy it
he's a one man riot
cleanin the community of all it's debris
the c-r-i-m-e
the road was long and scary and some didn't make it
the average guy couldn't take it
but jack is not the average guy
he took a piece of the pie and bit it
got with it for his brother he did it
so you gotta admit it
this is a martyr a soldier a hero
why? because he started from zero
in this battle he clearly understands their power
they're payin' people by the hour
to sell to lie to try to stand up and deny
they are gettin' everybody high
high on a cable cash under the table
currency is how they're able
to buy the cops and props and keep the law paid
but here comes the jack of spades

 d-nice scratches jack jack

you can't find it boy you're still blinded
why don't you open your eyes and stop dissin
get a prescription to listen
sit in the class and ask real fast about a fresh rap
you're gettin' left back set back kept back
get back i don't accept that material
your rhymes are artificially flavored like cereal
i like clarity so when you come here
speak clear and concise and then i might give
a little slack to nah wait - i take that back
if you're wack i'll slap fuck that
boogie down productions back simply 'cause we never left
the radical sounds of krs
what a mess to roll up and then 'fess
wild guess huh you thought you were the best?
but - yup yup - as it always turns out
you get burned out your rhymes just run out
i immediately come out boomin dope and
don't provoke you're walkin' a very thin rope
not even rope the word i'm lookin' for is string
when i sing i sing to try and bring
enlightenment yet the suckers be bitin it
radio's fightin it the fans be likin it
your face i'm wipin it cause your mouth is dirty
you're unworthy to think that you can serve me
you heard me? these styles are universal
you need rehearsal wait first i'll
beef up the system rhyth rhymin timin climbin
then realizing
as producer of this dope record huh
i think it's time we break for a second

that's it that's it that's it
break is over back to the track

we don't lack i mean we don't like
the played out styles when we're rockin' the mic
the radical rebel at level fifteen
the amp only goes to ten you know what i mean?

you steal come before me and kneel but
i'm not a king i'm not a queen i'm not a ace
i'm not a jack i'm not a mc or a playboy
and i just ain't wack
i feel that you should get an understanding
you might be jamming but krs-one is slamming
hypothetically or in reality
takin' you out is a small technicality
rhymes like these or rhymes like this one
comes in handy while i diss some
soft silly low budget sucker like yourself
i got the style you need in my house on the shelf
labelled sucker boy style
i like to do it every once in a while",1
7,"just like i told you you must learn

it's calm yet wild the style that i speak
just filled with facts and you will never get weak in the heart
in fact you'll start to illuminate knowledge to others in a song
let me demonstrate the force of knowledge
knowledge reigned supreme
the ignorant is ripped to smithereens
what do you mean when you say i'm rebellious
'cause i don't accept everything that you're telling us
what are you selling us the creator dwellin' us
i sit in your unknown class while you're failing' us
i failed your class 'cause i ain't with your reasoning
you're tryin' make me you by seasoning
up my mind with see jane run see john walk in a hardcore new york
it doesn't exist no way no how
it seems to me that in a school that's ebony
african history should be pumped up steadily but it's not
and this has got to stop see spot run run get spot
insulting to a black mentality a black way of life
or a jet black family so i include with one concern that
you must learn

chorus just like i told you you must learn twice

i believe that if you're teaching history
filled with straight up facts no mystery
teach the student what needs to be taught
'cause black and white kids both take shorts
when one doesn't know about the other ones' culture
ignorance swoops down like a vulture
'cause you don't know that you ain't just a janitor
no one told you about benjamin banneker
a brilliant black man that invented the almanac
can't you see where krs is coming at
with elie whitney holly selosy grand bill woods
made the walky-talky
lewis latterman improved on edison
charles drew did a lot for medicine
garrett morgan made the traffic lights
harriet tubman freed the slaves at night
madame cj walker made a straightin' comb
but you won't know this is you weren't shown
the point i'm gettin' at it it might be harsh
'cause we're just walkin' around brainwashed
so what i'm sayin' is not to diss a man
we need the 89 school system
one that caters to a black return because
you must learn",1

the only way to deal with racism if you're black

well seven in the morning i woke up to jog
rushed out the door to inhale the smog
as i ran i began to wonder
should i produce or should i tour this summer
well just that second i heard stay where you are
before i could stop i was hit by a cop car
i laid on the pavement like i was hurt
then a redneck cop jumped out with a smirk
he said ah boy you better watch where you run
as he poked my side with the barrel of his shotgun
i said officer man i ain't do nothin'
he said what's that word you n----s use ya frontin?
well ya frontin so why were you running down the street?
at this time i had stood to my feet and said wait a minute
and that's when he did it he hit me in the face with his gun i wasn't
with it so
on the ground was a bottle of snapple i broke the bottle in his fucking
adam's apple
as he fell his partner called for backup well i had the shotgun and
began to act up with that

well i threw down the gun and began to run
i got back in no time and loaded the nine
first i took two clips and then i took two more
i was out the window cause by now they were right at my door
i took three shots and then i laid
they rushed in shooting so i threw a quick grenade
it went boom like a supernova
badges arms heads legs cops were all over
i jumped out the fire escape down to the street and i started to run you
know i couldn't feel my feet i was weak i said to myself holy shit
my shirt had filled with blood i didn't know i got hit but there's no
time to stop no time to explain man i'm in too deep with this everyday
ghetto pain
black men are judged by their clothes
black women are looked at as hoes
so i as one of these uppity n----s
can only rely on the sound of a trigga going

well i staggered down the street to an old bookstore
called the tree of life yo d it ain't there no more
but when it was boy i was lucky
cause in the basement is where they stuck me
when i awoke at the 14th hour
three black women had gave me a quick shower
i stayed a while and escaped in a truck
driven by two guys rakim and chuck
what the fuck i asked as i laid there how many guys do you drive a day
there? chuck said many rakim said plenty it's an everyday thing when
you're willing to sing a song

you pay for the hits the advice is free
in this industry we gotta grow
commercial some go but y'know
just as important as they are
so is the underground superstar like me
you gotta ask yourself one question
do i speak facts or do i start guessin?
learn the lesson before you plan your career
commercial or underground where
do you fit cause both sides write hits
and all is rap i'll admit
but what i've come to explain
is that these people love to play a game
they wanna make it seem like you're wrong
for writin the reality song

don't touch those issues don't talk about dat
we don't take knowledge rap

what? they want you on their bases

yeah they won't stop it
i guess it's all right to act demonic
i guess it's all right to act demonic
but that's another chapter in another book
i've come to show a different look

not just the commercial pap

from which rap music was found
so you can't deny it you cannot refuse it
i'll be rockin' that ghetto music

ghetto music yeah they'll never chart it

is to strengthen and uplift the mind

but the nigga kept pushin the goddamn issue
so i pulled out the 9mm
and bust his ass in the head you could see the
blood gushin out his goddamn skull

i was charged with aggravated assault
but before i got off his ass
i made him read these nikes

call the police they got robbed
right under their nose it have to be an inside job

i grabbed the slimmy by her hand and lead her upstairs
threw her down on the bed and she said fuck yeah
i opened up her legs prepared her for the stabbin
like mike tyson in the fourth boy i was jabbin
the bitch was sweatin but i guess she wasn't bothered
cause all she said was fuck me harder fuck me harder
i started bangin' i was bangin' dick was numbin
she wasn't hangin' she was singin' brad i'm comin'
up and down side to side perfect timin
i started stickin with the quickness we were grindin
i was just about to nut she got on top of me
i heard a shot now what the fuck? somebody shot at me
i took a look the girl was cooked her head exploded
reached for the uzi at my foot and i unloaded
straight out the window i could hear the soldiers' footsteps
i'm a taker not a faker i ain't been took yet
so many hunters dyin' faces to the concrete
although you try to take me out you die in one beat
of the heart boy how dare you try to sucker me?
and i'ma teach you and your boys not to fuck with me
rolled out the backdoor lookin' for his bossman
i'll watch him bleedin pour his blood in a saucepan
he's in his cadillac starin' at my frontdoor
i snuck behind him pulled my gun said what you front for?
he says i'm sorry act don't kill me i was jokin griff
that's why your boys are on my balcony and they're frozen stiff
the boy was shocked then pulled up cops he looked at me said you're a goner
cause you shot and killed the boys who worked my corner
pulled back the hammer put my gun up almost point blank
shattered his dome reached in the pocket took the boy's bank
got out the cadillac the copper he said stop it freeze
i aim my pistol for his stomach but i pop his knees
fell to the floor he looked at me and he said action please
i put my gun between his eyes said don't breathe
he took a breath and he knew he'd breathe his last breath
that's 20 soldiers and copper 21 shot to death
i had to leave everything i'd ever worked for
but best believe i won't get sentenced for a drug war
but maybe one day in the future i can come back
but until then i'm goin' home where i'm from black
nobody knows my name they'll only know my face
and ask my posse they say we call him scarface

watchin the guys talk your boys watch your back
this game is dangerous you're livin' in fear

what started off as a game ended the lives of 2 cops
life in the fast lane

another hot spot you screech to a halt
yo look what i've got then reach for the wall
they find the product and the cops'll say oh~
they'll put your butt in the bump
roll to the station yo captain whassup?

straight to the jail cell no 9 or a clip
and the ones you triple-crossed'll want revenge so get hip
out in an hour on your way to the pad
a copper starts to trail you now you're sweatin bad
turn on his flashers you stop tommy tucker
he stuck his head in the window so you shot him like a sucker
fell to the pavement blood pourin on the cement
there's witnesses standin by and you knew that he seen it
back on the run again and the boys on your block
was blabbin all to the cops about the people you shot
did you get nervous well why continue your route?
when you know that normal folks don't chill with blood on their suits
took off his jacket flung to the back
grabbin a pull from the pack i gotta break i get back
right to his rock spot before the brother got shot
he tried to sell 2 ki's to tony that was filled full of sheet rock
bumped off~ they ain't let him slide

way he died was a shame pushin 'caine

life in the fast lane while countin' cash i'd
sit back and wonder what would become of me
the fiends would see the beemer comin' and then they'd run to me
step out the vehicle yo what you need joe?

leavin' out her house grabbed the bitch by her mouth
drug her back in slammed her down on the couch
whipped out my knife said if you scream i'm cuttin
opened her legs and commenced the fuckin'
she begged me not to kill her i gave her a rose
then slit her throat and watched her shake till her eyes closed
had sex with the corpse before i left her
and drew my name on the wall like helter skelter
run for shelter never crossed my mind

went to the back and grabbed a shovel
now granny's on her way to meet the devil
pulled out my 38 and aimed at the bitch
a cop says freeze muthafucka bitch suck my dick
i said die muthafuckas as i blasted
something clicked in my head visions of bodies in plastic
the scent of buckshots in human flesh
pigs dyin' from bullet wounds to the chest
no sheriff's gonna take me on a road
dark as fuck and let his pistols explode
fuck that 'cause i ain'ts to die
so i reloaded my uzi and fired up another fry
it got me crazy as fuck

the cops had the place surrounded
hunted for a way to get out - i found it
innocent bystanders watch me set an example
i popped one let me go goddammit
scot free
or all of these muthafuckas comin' with me
all of a sudden the shit got silent
i remember wakin' up in an asylum
bein treated like a troubled kid
my shirt was all bloody and both of my wrists was slit
think this is harsh? this ain't as harsh as it gets
no tellin' what's bein thought up in the mind of a lunatic

maniac
maniac
ma- mani- maniac
i can't quit

verse 5 willie d
november 1st 1966
a damn fool was born with the mind of a lunatic
i shoulda been killed
but sister fucked around and let me live
now i developed a criminal behaviour
fuck with me and i'll slay ya
ass beyond recognition shit
your dental records couldn't prove your identity bitch
i beg your pardon on talkin' to borden
you'll never find a muthafucka so save your milk cartons
cross the line your ass is mine
i don't give a fuck if you're 9 or 99
blind crippled and crazy don't faze me
your funky ass will be pushin up daisies
you wanna know what makes me click?
my psychiatrist said i got the mind of a lunatic

let's get out of here that guy is crazy
ma- ma- ma- maniac

verse 6 willie d
i ain't got it all so don't fuck with me
unless your ass wanna be made history
i'll blow your muthafuckin house up
and if your wife and kids are inside they're fucked
i don't give a damn who i slay
don't let me get a hold of some e&ampj
'cause when the shit hit the fan
i'll stab your ass quicker than a mexican
the nightmares i leave you with on the scene
will make freddy bitch ass look like a wet dream
this is fact not fictional son of a bitch
i got the mind of a lunatic",1
0,"baby cryin' scary music laughin' voice 

good evening and welcome to eazy's playhouse
you stupid muthafuckaaaaaa

a low bass metal voice 

now that you got the album
what the fuck are you gonna do with it
bitch bitch bitch bitch 

eazily i aproach the microphone because i ain't no joke
tell your momma to get off of my tip
i have no time to give her my dick
i'm gonna hold it
and walk around the stage and
if you fuck up i'm goin' to get my gauge and
unload the barrel and laugh
'cause i'm puttin' lead in your mothafuckin' ass
psychopathic but the ho's are attracted
because when i'm on hard my dick's at least a yard
in the days of old i was a nut
now i need at least 3 ho's when i fuck
'cause i do a check nut 1 nut 2
then i save a nut for when there's nothin' else to do
get used to the crew bitch
'cause i would never quit
as soon as you think that's it i'm still talkin' shit

-=- cut -=-

i told you that nigga was crazy
e boy that's my boy godamnit

-=- cut -=-

i got a fable that you need to listen to
it's a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
one sharon and the other one shaun
i want to nut but which one do i want?
shaun said eazy let me fuck you blind
and sharon said e i want to blow your mind
i said fuck it i know what should be done
just pull your panties down and i'll fuck the biggest one
and then i get the other pussy put it in the freezer
so i can always have a on-hold skeezer
get out the ticket i do it like that
so i told the ho's to take a big step back
took the zipper down eyes wide and said
here's what i'm gonna put inside
grab it like a rabbit grab it let's work it
but i won't love you
when i'm done i'd still be talkin' shit 

-=- cut -=-

that boy'z good
yeah that boy's good
that mothafucka'z talkin' all kinds of shit
i used to get pussy like eazy eric every day
you're mothafuckin' lyin'
how you know i'm mothafuckin' lyin'?
you're lyin' your dick can't get hard 
oh suck my dick mothafucka
nigga you lied
who you're talkin' to?


-=- cut -=-

dre  wait a minute wait a minute cut that shit
hey yo yella boy wantcha rewind it

-=- cut -=-

niggaz don't see i'm a 100% legit
and you know it ain't about all that bullshit
it's about fuckin' this bitch and that bitch
but not the bitch with the 7 day itch like that ho'
just throwin' me the pussy
she says she wants to do it like a doggy
she's bad nobody is badder
but she got more crabs than a seafood platter
bitch on the gank move to skeaze me
just to say i got fucked by eazy
so i slapped the ho' like a pimp
i might be a women-beater but i'm not a pussy-eater
so when the shit hits the fan it's outta my mouth
you don't like what i'm talkin' about
all of y'all can just suck my dick
you can quote me now 'cause i'm still talkin' shit 

-=- cut -=-

the boy's good i told you the boy's good
the nigga has talent
you don't know a damn thing
yeah i like that part bring that shit back one more time maestro
i can do the bugaloo
that old shit did'nt play out in 1967 
hey fuck you fuck you ",1
1,"yo ren you're ready to go get this move?
believe that boy
you're strapped?
yeah you know it
let's go do this man i got it all planned out
yeah shoot any motherfucker that moves
all right everybody

this is a stick-up everybody get face-down
ren gag their mouths so they can't make a sound
tie 'em up for the fact that i'm kickin ass
i got my hand on my gat and i'm tempted to blast
my name is eazy but i go the hard way out
this ain't personal but now i'm about
to commit a crime and go through with it
you know what no need for shakin because i'm used to it
take out the security guard with a slap of my hand
yeah he's wearin' a badge but he's a ol ass man
pump his ass in the head and take his gun
so me and the punk can go one on one
cover the lens on the tv screen
you know so me and my gang just can't be seen
lock the doors and throw away the key
close the blinds so no motherfuckers can see
and smile you know 'cause i'm controllin the shit
and no sucker ass nigga's gonna stop the hit
wardrobes and locs and a ruthless shirt
that means i'm ready to work and rush a fool to the dirt so

nobody moves nobody get hurt
nobody moves nobody get hurt
nobody moves nobody get hurt
nobody moves nobody get hurt

all right anybody move and i'll blow your fuckin' head off

all right
empty your pockets but do it slow
take everything you got and lay it on the fuckin' floor
don't make me have to set an example today
and blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away
i'm in a bank and it's a little bit funny
takin' all you stupid motherfuckers' money
peepin at a bitch cause my dick's on hard
laughin' at the dumb ass security guard
who's tied up for the moment not sayin' a word
i should have known it before the motherfucker's a nerd
but back to the bitches i'm peepin
and then untie the hoe so i can start creepin'
took her to the backroom about to jack
cold trailed the bitch with a gun in the back
i said lay down and unbutton your bra
there was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw
i said damn then the air got thinner
only thought in my mind was goin' up in her
the suspense was makin' me sick
she took her panties down and the bitch had a dick
i said damn dropped the gat from my hand
what i thought was a bitch was nothing but a man
put the gat to his legs all the way up his skirt
because this is one faggot that i had to hurt so

nobody moves nobody get hurt
nobody moves nobody get hurt
nobody moves nobody get hurt
nobody moves nobody get hurt

i said get down i want you all face-down on the floor
anybody moves and i shoot

stackin up the money and there's more to collect
'cause i don't give a fuck i take traveler's checks
yo ren peep out the window and tell me what you see
three motherfuckin police starin' at me what to do now?
hurry up and get on
all right tell me who hit the motherfuckin alarm?
i'm a give ya a chance and count to three
or else five of y'all bitches are comin' with me
police all right all right come on out niggaz or we're coming in
this is the only chance to turn yourself in
fuck you we got hostages and plenty of loot
and don't give a damn and not afraid to shoot
we're sendin out the hostages all except five
and if you don't meet our demands they won't stay alive
we want a copter so we can get away clean
and take some pussy along if you know what i mean
one hostage got brave and got off the floor
but i smoked his ass before he got to the door
police they shot a hostage they shot a hostage
mc ren you stupid motherfucker tryin' to run
now you're dead as fuck tryin' to race a gun
police all right this is the last chance to get off your ass
or else the tear gas is about to blast

i ran to the back and ren followed behind
to a hell of a spot that was hard to find
the bank was fucked up the shit was smokin'
with screamin hostages runnin' and chokin
gettin' away but i was suddenly stopped
at point blank range by a motherfuckin cop
and i hope they don't think that a lesson was taught
cause a nigga like the e was finally caught
my gat wouldn't fire the shit wouldn't work
so y'all know what time it is

nobody moves nobody get hurt
nobody moves nobody get hurt
nobody moves nobody get hurt
nobody moves nobody get hurt

police well i'm giving you five seconds to let us through the gate or
i'm gonna shoot two of your guards

they got me once but they'll never get me again",1

and some hell of a scream from the girls in the back

my rhyme does work when i put it to use
makes me glow when i'm walkin' up and down the deuce

girls always wanna whisper somethin' in my ear
at a show old ladies even waitin in line
and it all takes place on the count of my rhyme

talkin' 'bout my rhyme

delite
my rhyme is the force of sheer suspense
the stroke of elegance and excellence
the best and no less seizing in your interest
my rhyme is packed with the muscle and finesse
satisfaction guaranteed as i get ill
definitely approved that's a thrill to thrill
my rhyme ??????? the escapade
or at least as a teacher from my trade
of my rhyme

fruitkwan
my rhyme's wrapped in a fury of hate
and dare a devil rhyme rebel my axe terminate
subduin and pulverizin suckers from afar
couldn't sling with the king i'm a hazardous detour
break north suckers i'm intensively hard

it might be quiet but it's deliberated
and when it rocks the mic it stays motivated

hooray you toot and chant when my rhymes are played
if i may today demonstrate my sway

quakin earth crashin symbols ringin' bells over towns
and you all wanna come hearin daddy-o's rhyme
sucker mc's fear it my fans all cheer it
my rhyme's a category of personafied lyric
livin' it tastes feels hears and sees
you may not believe it but my rhyme breathes
it only dresses in the freshest gear
and it never wears words that i wore last year
in the summer you may hear it in la at a show
or at miami gettin' played at a radio show

my rhyme is devious but believe me it's
one of a kind you agree from the previous
rhymes that you're hearin is devastatin
this rhyme made tschernobyl stop generatin
after effects of my rhyme gets bolder

to any size big or small and i can even reduce

about what took place with me and wise
went walkin' one morning with our new suits on
wise in his adidas me and my benetton
coolin out drinkin' stout talkin' 'bout the world
when we were suddenly stopped by a beautiful girl
she was gorgeous she told us that her name was faye
she would like to get busy for the rest of the day
well of course we replied but whose date will you be?
she said 1 or 2 it makes no difference to me
whoa we was with it had a freak we could tell
dialed the first seven digits to the best hotel
in town rented a room and not a sec too soon
ordered delicious lunch about half past noon
after stuffin our face well faye wanted a drink
we ordered up the strongest drink that we could think
after she got a little tipsy i gave wise the look
'cause we could smell faye's tunafish startin to cook
she started pantin and breathin and lickin' her lips
and then the next thing you know she was rubbin our hips
freakin wise on the bed freakin me in the corner
i said why faye why? she said 'cause i wanna
man it went on for i don't know how long
i thought that i knew strength but that girl was strong
and how i knew her sexy lovin' wouldn't steer me wrong?
when she kissed me on the chest she kissed me on the neck
she kissed me on the cheek and sang this song
she said
starts to sing
higher than the highest mountain
and deeper than the deepest sea
that's how i will love you
so darlin' endlessly
break it down wise
she said
if you think i'm sexy
say little boy reach out and touch me
if you really need me
say little boy reach out and tell me
and gimme your lovin' gimme your lovin'
don't forget about the all-night squeezin
and don't forget about the huggin and teasin
- overall it was a good afternoon
man i hope that me and you get to see faye soon

don't stop the wop until you break your arm
we're on fire raw and we're god-conceived
the electrifyin act of intensity

prince paul scratching

verse 4 all
we-we-we took a little time
wrote a little rhyme
spent a little money on some studio time
came up with a fresh little funky beat
added a scratch to make it all complete
and now it's on wax so we can relax
and work a little harder on a little more tracks
it might add up to a little more tax
at the end of the year we claim it all back
when we're coolin on the block we carry our big box
playin' ll's 'rock the bells' or run's 'rock box'
wearin some high-top cons or some fila socks
and the newest benetton sweatshirt in stock
we rent a cadillac stretch and explore the town
and if some fly girls pass we roll our windows down
and say hey fly girl can we take you to the wire?
we're the band called stet - and we're on fire
we're ?flyer than chicks? and rollin' our punches
and when it comes to rhymes we write 'em in bunches
put us at back we went triple headers
try to get stet we'll just get stetter
and if you call us a crew we'll call you a liar
we're the band called stet my man and we're on fire

i didn't teach a poet that we goin' to fail
but when the test came you know we passed
'cause we the best mc's in the whole gym class

frukwan
up and down and all around
now bust the rhythm of the stetsa sound
bring if you feel you wants to get snotty
take a good look at the size of the party
it's six on the mix and human percus'
dbc on the keys and the three will discuss us
'cause we're the must and the cuts we trust
grand wizard prince paul is ya vitamin plus

delite
we go back and forth and forth and back
wit the rhyme on time we cuttin' on slack
wit the chance to advance and hand yo dash
wit the rhythm that's flown from us to france
we got the dbc to devastate the keys
and the light skinned brother on the mix machine
it's not a funk machine that cause a heart attack
but the mighty prince paul on the old 8-track

holdin an m16 see with the pen i'm extreme
now bullet holes left in my peep holes
i'm suited up with street clothes
hand me a nine and i'll defeat foes
y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay
i keep some e&ampj sittin bent up in the stairway
or either on the corner bettin grants with the cee-lo champs
laughing at baseheads trying to sell some broken amps
g-packs get off quick forever niggas talk shit
reminiscin about the last time the task force flipped
niggas be runnin through the block shootin
time to start the revolution catch a body head for houston
once they caught us off guard the mac-10 was in the grass and
i ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
picked the mac up told brothers back up the mac spit
lead was hittin niggas one ran i made him backflip
heard a few chicks scream my arm shook couldn't look
gave another squeeze heard it click yo my shit is stuck
tried to cock it it wouldn't shoot now i'm in danger
finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
so now i'm jettin to the buildin lobby
and it was full of children probably couldn't see as high as i be
so what you saying? it's like the game ain't the same
got younger niggas pullin the triggers bringing fame to they name
and claim some corners crews without guns are goners
in broad daylight stickup kids they run up on us
45s and gauges macs in fact
same niggas'll catch a back to back
snatchin your cracks in black
yo theres a snitch on the block gettin niggas knocked
so hold your stash 'til the coke price drops
i know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
and if it's good she'll bring ya customers and measurin pots
but yo you gotta slide on a vacation
inside information keeps large niggas erasin and they wives basin'
it drops deep as it does in my breath

winnin gunfights with mega cops

make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
i ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin
give me a smith &amp wesson i'll have niggas undressin
thinkin of cash flow buddha and shelter
whenever frustrated i'ma hijack delta
in the pj's my blend tape plays bullets and strays
young bitches is grazed each block is like a maze
full of black rats trapped plus the island is packed
from what i hear in all the stories when my peoples come back black
i'm livin where the nights is jet black
the fiends fight to get crack i just max i dream i can sit back
and lamp like capone with drug scripts sewn
or the legal luxury life rings flooded with stones homes
i got so many rhymes i don't think i'm too sane
life is parallel to hell but i must maintain and be prosperous
though we live dangerous cops could just
arrest me blaming us we're held like hostages
it's only right that i was born to use mics
and the stuff that i write is even tougher than dice
i'm takin rappers to a new plateau through rap slow
my rhymin is a vitamin held without a capsule
the smooth criminal on beat breaks
never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
the city never sleeps full of villains and creeps
that's where i learned to do my hustle had to scuffle with freaks
i'm a addict for sneakers twenties of buddha and bitches with beepers
in the streets i could greet ya about blunts i teach ya
inhale deep like the words in my breath
i never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death
i lay puzzled as i backtrack to earlier times

visualizing the realism of life in actuality
fuck who's the baddest a person's status depends on salary
and my mentality is money orientated
i'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
'cause yeah we were beginners in the hood as five percenters
but something must've got in us 'cause all of us turned to sinners
now some rest in peace and some are sittin' in san quentin
others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition
keeping this schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
even though we know somehow we all gotta go
but as long as we leaving thievin' we'll be leavin' with some kind of dough so
until that day we expire and turn to vapors
me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
keeping it real packing steel getting high

life's a bitch and then you die that's why we get high

the essence of adolescence leaves my body now i'm fresh and
my physical frame is celebrated 'cause i made it
one quarter through life some godly-like thing created
got rhymes three sixty-five days annual plus some
load up the mic and bust one cuss while i pus from
my skull 'cause it's pain in my brain vein money maintain
don't go against the grain simple and plain
when i was young at this i used to do my thing hard
robbin' foreigners take their wallets their jewels and rip they green cards
dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
got my first piece of ass smokin' blunts with hash
now it's all about cash in abundance
niggas i used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
i switched my motto 'stead of saying fuck tomorrow
that buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
once i stood on the block loose cracks produce stacks
i cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
time is illmatic keep static like wool fabric
pack a four-matic to crack your whole cabbage

life's a bitch and then you die that's why we get high
'cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die that's why we puff lye
'cause you never know when you're gonna go

and he be pumping on your block your man gave him your glock
and now they run together what up son whatever
since i'm on the streets i'mma put it to a cease
but i heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
wilding on the island but now in elmira
better chill 'cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
but maintain when you come home the corner's ours

when we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
but chill see you on the next v-i
i gave your mom dukes loot for kicks plus sent you flicks
your brother's buckwilding in 4-main he wrote me
he might beat his case till he come home he'll play it low key
so stay civilized time flies

sometimes i sit back with a buddha sack
mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
written in school text books bibles et cetera
fuck a school lecture the lies get me vexed-er
so i be ghost from my projects i take my pen and pad
for the weekend hittin l's while i'm sleeping
a two day stay you may say i need the time alone
to relax my dome no phone left the nine at home
you see the streets had me stressed something terrible
fucking with the corners have a nigga up in bellevue
or hdm hit with numbers from eight to ten
a future in a maximum state pen is grim
so i comes back home nobody's out but shorty doo-wop
rolling two phillies together in the bridge we called 'em ooh-wops
he said nas niggas could be busting off the roof
so i wear a bulletproof and pack a black trey-deuce
he inhaled so deep shut his eyes like he was sleep
started coughing one eye peeked to watch me speak
i sat back like the mack my army suit was black
we was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
i took the l when he passed it this little bastard
keeps me blasted and starts talking mad shit
i had to school him told him don't let niggas fool him
'cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one
tough luck when niggas are struck families fucked up
coulda caught your man but didn't look when you bucked up
mistakes happen so take heed never bust up
at the crowd catch him solo make the right man bleed
shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
then i rose wiping the blunt's ash from my clothes
then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
and told my little man i'm ghost i broze
left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
words of wisdom from nas try to rise up above
keep an eye out for jake shorty wop one love

back in the days when i was a teenager
before i had status and before i had a pager
you could find the abstract listening to hip hop
my pops used to say it reminded him of be-bop
i said well daddy don't you know that things go in cycles
the way that bobby brown is just ampin like michael
it's all expected things are for the lookin'
if you got the money quest is for the bookin
come on everybody let's get with the fly modes
still got room on the truck load the back boom
listen to the rhyme to get a mental picture
of this black man through black woman victim
why do i say that 'cause i gotta speak the truth man
doing what we feel for the music is the proof and
planted on the ground the act is so together
bonafide strong you need leverage to sever
the unit yes the unit yes the unit called the jazz is
deliberately cheered lp filled with street goods
you can find it on the rack in your record store store
if you get the record then your thoughts are adored
and appreciated 'cause we're ever so glad we made it
we work hard so we gotta thank god
dishin out the plastic do the dance till you're spastic
if you dis it gets drastic
listen to the rhymes 'cause its time to make gravy
if it moves your booty then shake shake it baby
all the way to africa aka the motherland uh
stick out the left then i'll ask for the other hand
that's the right hand black man man
only if you are noted as my man man
if i get the credit then i'll think i deserve it
if you fake moves don't fix your mouth to word it
get in the zone of positivity not negativity
'cause we gotta strive for longevity
if you botch up what's in that ass what?
a pair of nikes size ten-and-a-half come on come on


we gotta make moves
never ever ever could we fake moves come on come on 4x

time time is a ship on a merciless sea
drifting toward an average of nothingness
until it can be retarded for it's own destiny
time is an inanimate object
praying and praying and praying with no justification for belief
time is dancing moving lingering all memories of past
- the last poets

we gotta be a winner all the time
can't fall prey to a hip hop crime
with the dope raps and dope tracks for you for blocks
from the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
musically the quest is on the rise
we on these excursions so you must realize
that continually i pop my zulu
if you don't like it get off the zulu tip
so what can you do in the times which exist
you can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
but if your sis is a bitch brother is a jerk
leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
whatever it may be in today's society
everything is fair at least that how it seems to me
you must be honest and true to the next
don't be phony and expect one not to flex
especially if you rhyme you have to live by the pen
your man is your man then treat him like your friend
all it is is the code of the streets
so listen to the knowledge bein dropped over beats
beats that are hard beats that are funky
it could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
what you gotta do to is know that the tribe is in the sphere
the abstract poet prominent like shakespeare


edgar allan poe it don't stop uh

time is running out on black power africans in the day
and white thigh supporters at night
everytime you see them they're chasing some white woman with their tongues hangin' out
time is running and passing passing and running

yo when you bug out you usually have a reason for the action
sometimes you don't it's just for mere satisfaction
people be hounding always surrounding
pulsing just like a migraine pounding
you don't really fret you stay in your sense
camouflage your feeling of absolute tense
you soar off to another world deep in your mind
but people seem to take that as being unkind
oh yo he's acting stank really on a regal?
a man of the fame not a man of the people
believe that if you wanna but i tell you this much
riding on the train with no dough sucks
once again a case of your feet in my nike's

1988 senior year at garvey high
where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
loungin with the tipster coolin with sha
scopin out the honeys - they know who they are
i was the b-ball playin' fly rhyme sayin'
fly girl gettin' but never was i sweatin
'cause when it came to honeys i would go on a stroll
until i met my match - her name was flo
yeah - i messed around with the one called flo
all the troopers round the way used to call her a ho
but deep down in my heart i knew that flo was good to go
'cause i thought it was me - like bell biv devoe
but little did i know that she was playin' with my mind
the only thing i've learned is good girls are hard to find
i feel like heavy d i need somebody for me
not someone who's mind is blank and tryin' to juice me for my bank
swingin' with my main man lucky behind my back
what type of crap is that - yo how's about a smack?
word life i can't front - thought i was all that
but now it seems i met my match
was a stone cold lover you couldn't tell me jack
settlin' down with one girl wasn't tryin' to hear that
i had tonya tamika sharon karen
tina stacy julie tracy
used to love 'em leave 'em skeeze 'em tease 'em
find 'em lose 'em - also abuse 'em
my whole attitude was new day next hon
and believe it or not they all got done
well here comes flo with the crazy whip appeal
and i'm all true man like alexander o'neal
is this really love then again how would i know
after all this time tryin' to be a superhoe
she finally played me but yo i'd find another
'cause i got the crazy game and yo i'm smooth like butter

chorus q-tip

butter like butter baby  repeat 2x
not no parkay not no margarine
strickly butter baby strictly butter

verse two phife dawg

i remember when
girls were goodie two shoes but now they turned to freaks
all of a sudden we love you phife - ease of ho my name's malik
phife this phife that where you goin' where you at
these girls don't know me from jack yet i feel like the mack
you didn't want me then so yo hon don't want me now
here here - take the towel wipe off your brow
and take the contact out your eye you're far from lookin' fly
you get an e for effort and t for nice try
now tell me what's the reason for dyin' your hair
slum village gold still danglin in your ear
you barely have a neck but still sportin' a rope
four-finger ring just so phifer can scope
you looked in the mirror didn't know what to do
yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
and if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
if your hair and eyes were real i wouldn't have dissed ya
but since it was bought i had to dismiss ya
but if you can't achieve it then why not try and weave it
if you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
if you can't braid it best thing to do is fade it
i asked who did your hair and you tell me diane made it
if you were you and just you talk to you maybe
but i can't stand no bionic lady
tryin' hard to look fly but yo you're lookin' dumber
if i wanted someone like you i woulda swung with jamie summers
you wanna be treated right see father mc
or check ralph tresvant for sens-a-tiv-i-ty
see i am not the one i got more game than parker brothers
phife dog is on the mic and i'm smooth like butter",2

i had a dream about my man last night
and my man came by the studio
and his name is
busta rhymes in effect shaheed is in effect
phife did-awg is in effect
check it out and give me my 'spect

i'm movin yes i'm groovin 'cause my mouth is on the motor
use the coast in the mornin to avoid the funky odor
can't help bein funky i'm the funky abstract brotha
funky in a sense but i play the undacova
once had a fetish fetish for some booty
now i'm gettin' funky and my rappin' that's my duty
brothas tend to jock on the style in particular
if you got the ego like some brothas then i'll get with ya
but if i don't pursue then i just don't give a fuck
my motto in the 90's is be happy makin' bucks
girls love the jim 'cause it causes crazy friction
when it goes up in and fluctuates the diction
i still understand the uh 'cause that's what i met her for
i'm hooked on the swings so just call me the music whore
women love the voice brothas dig the lyrics
quest the people's choice we thrive it for the spirit
if you can't hear it then get the wax utensils
write my rhymes straight up don't get with no fancy stencil
the rhymes we get is sweet we stay away from tart
a perfectionist at work perkin up the art
if you want to battle i suggest you check your clock
your demise is comin' up and i want your man to watch
be the prime example i deep instilled the sample
insignificance here i'll place you on the mantle
born up in harlem reside down in jamaica
the girl i used to rock her moms was a claker
now what does that make her? the evil money taker?
the crazy move faker i used that to break her

vinia mojica singing in the background
phife is in the house uncle mike is in the house
bob power is in the house tim latham is in the house
wise men is in the house the brand nubes is in the house
the jay bee they in the house and de la they in the house

i must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people
please don't be deceived by ugly slice of evil
the world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
wrap yourself up in it if you love it then you'll thank it
don't move to rebuttal wave your hand for action
some women in the '90's want more than satisfaction
they want keys and gs and all those illy things
if you want to i'll show you just what the ab can bring
i keep a tight net with my brothas ken and kenny
if the question is of rhymes then i'll tell ya i got plenty
the thing that men and women need to do is stick together
progressions can't be made if we're separate forever
i hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature
is the funky singin' by miss vinia mojica
so listen because the quest is led through the underground
my people have been oppressed too long no more will we be down
people tend to riff 'cause they don't know the mental
people tend to bug 'cause their beats are hard but gentle
afro kinda lurks through the body of this youngun'
play like bobby byrd on your back and your comin' to
the house of the jazz of the funk of the rhythm
all the goods are welcome but if you're a villain
i'll just wait and debate contemplate your arrival
if flexin is your motive then you don't like survival
the abstract is speakin' the hard beats is reachin'
the black and puerto ricans
'cause their butt naked streakin through the ever murky streets
of the urbanized areas
blastin out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria

craig is in the house pete rock is in the house
cl is in the house ultra mag is in the house
nice and smooth is in the house big daddy kane is in the house
beatnuts is in the house special ed is in the house

yeah 7x
this one goes out to my man
thanks a lot ron carter on the bass
yes my man ron carter is on the bass
now check it out
born into the 91 decade
you gotta say the quest is on
and goddamn it yes the quest is on
and we out",2

where you see the pretty girls
in the high animated world
checking for a rapper with all the dough
if you take a shit they want to know
and if you're gonna fall they won't be around y'all
so you still wanna do the show business?
and you think that you got what it takes?
i mean you really gotta rap and be all that
and prepare yourself for the breaks
check it out

do you wanna be in the business? the business
the ups and downs with the hoes the business
always getting fronted on at shows the business
people gotta stick their nose in the business

yo i gotta speak on the cesspool
it's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
only if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people
ain't no-one your equal
especially on the industry side
don't let the games just glide
right through your fingers you gotta know the deal
so lord jamar speak because you're real

they're giving you the business and putting on a show
you're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
but you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
sedated and at that fact they elated
time pass and your ass say where's my loot?
the reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
all you wanna do is taste the fruit
but in the back they're making fruit juice
you ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
not able 'cause you signed at the table
for a pretty cash advance now they got a song and dance
that you didn't recoup more soup with your meal?
'cause this is the real when you get a record deal
and i say

aw shucks look what the cat hauled in
it's phife dawg from a tribe called quest let me begin
like chuck d i got so much trouble on my mind
'bout these no-talent artists getting signed they can't rhyme
and if that ain't bad you got bootleggers
going out like suckers motherfuckers
feel it's time that i let loose the lion
and if not that then i'll commence to head flying
seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme
and then you go and sell my tape for only $599?
please nigga i've worked too hard for this
no more will i take the booty end of the stick
bogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it
'cause they lyrics is played like 8-ball jackets
now tell me i can't tear it up
go get yourself some toilet paper 'cause your lyrics is butt

do you wanna be in the business? the business
people can't walk a straight line in the business
some of these brothers can't rhyme in the business
a-yo i'm tryna get mine the business

the party scene is cool but then again it's all the same
you see the same faces but at different places
when you're up and riding high everything is palsy-palsy
get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
well that's cool i can dig it it really ain't my bag
prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
oh he's a cutie yeah real cute
but i wasn't that cute when i didn't have no loot
although i hit a pound of herbs i'm still nice with the verbs
so fuck what you heard
the born cipher cipher master makes me think much faster
but critics still continue to plaster
my name and discredit my fame
all that shit is game
and i don't really give a damn
eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham

well excuse me i gotta add my two cents in
don't be alarmed the rhyme was condensed in
a matter of minutes so it must be told
all that glitters not gold
everybody wants a deal help me make a demo
see my name in bright lights ride around in a limo
my moms keeps beefing boy get a job
but i wanna make jams damn i know i'll slam
huh well it's not that easy
you gotta get a label that's willing and able
to market and promote and you better hope
for what? that the product is dope
take it from diamond it's like mountain climbing
when it comes to rhyming you gotta put your time in
get a good lawyer so problems won't pile
you don't wanna make a pitch that's wild",2
6,"q-tip

let me flaunt the style style i think that the time's near
that we drop studs studs there will be no duds here
rappers play the dumb dumb kinda on the space tip
but when they hear the jams jams they be on the dilsnick
now i'm not for the rock rock i know the territory
go ahead and try try that's a different story
similar to grimm grimm i can tell a better one
all about a kid kid who couldn't rap and didn't run
stand stand aside aside when the rap is gettin' dumb
resort to baggin billy billy askin can he have some
no never ever ever come back and try again man
if you come back back i'll be the first to shake your hand
competition's good good it brings out the vital parts
the abstract poetic 'etic majors in recital arts
do it for the kids kids the elders and the rap peers
we know the job is done done when we hear a lot of cheers
gotta feel the vibes vibes come from my creation
if the hands clap clap i'm filled with elation
here i am ghetto full with a lot of steam
think i gotta i think i gotta i think i gotta scream scream
'cause that's how good it feels child
let your hair down down so we can get buckwild
do your ill dance dance don't think about the next man
we must have unity and think of the bigger plan
division we will fall fall we must stick together see
i'd like to take this time time to say what's up to kool g
the name is q-tip tip the midnight marauder
give enough respect 'spect to afrika bambaataa
as a man in the world world i must do my job
take care of mama duke duke i won't resort to rob
bob you'll get your dough dough mase is my witness
obsessed with the rap rap for it's the mental fitness
like shootin cee-lo lo and always gettin' headcracks
the industry is luck luck winning with the fake raps

not sellin out out from hardrock to disc jock
from disc jock to hardrock from hardrock to disc jock

lookin' at miss lane it was the fast lane
barely knows her name struck by fame
she just got a benz she rides with her friends
gotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends
rollin' down the block checkin' out the spots
she winks at the cops always give her props
she knows she's the woman can't nobody touch her
hangs out for the loot makes her papes from the gutter
tried to make my moves on miss lane she called me young boy
told her not to dis me i just want to be your love toy
you young boy my love toy i doubt that very highly
just because you rhyme don't mean i'll let you try me
business oriented egos never dented
always sweet scented if it's business she meant it
distractions never hurt always did the work
always was alert she never got jerked
queen of the feats thrive to compete
love the funky beats while she drive down the street
she was justified couldn't get a job
had to feed her family so she had to play then rob
pullin out the ooh wop listenin to doo-wop
you don't have to say a word
gunshots that's all ya heard


she's not a big kahuna wish i met her sooner
instead i met her later my love is much greater
put me on her roster to rid her of imposters
and to sell the buddah for the sexy drug ruler
love is my motive now i'm drug promotive
plus i needed duckets to fill up my buckets
supplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy
now i'm missing action for this fatal attraction
but don't you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches
and don't you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches
'cause if you play me out i think i'll let ya be
i'll be damned if i let a brotha try to gas me
i played my cards well try to live swell
for the g i would sell 'cause i was deep in hell
but then i really wasn't she had a fly cousin
who would give me booty on the side of my cutie
elaine she kinda new that i would do the do
but she didn't tear i did my work with care
that's all that really mattered he money never splattered
as long as she was paid she was in the shade
you can't really blame her for holdin' on a flamer
society taught her but they didn't tame her
a ten clip salute hunny heres a troop
she will never stop until she reach the top

stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
the aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
just like ringling brothers i'll daze and astound
captivate the mass 'cause the prose was profound
do it for the strong we do it for the meek
boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your jeep
or your honda or your beemer or your legend or your benz
the rave of the town to your foes and your friends
so push it along trails we blaze
don't deserve the gong don't deserve the praise
the tranquility will make you unball your fist
for we put hip hop on a brand new twist
a brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
so low-key that you probably missed it
and yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
when the guy takes the beat they bowed
so raise up squire adjust your attire
we have no time to wallow in the mire
if you're on a foreign path then let me do the lead
join in the essence of the cool-out breed
then cool out to the music 'cause it makes you feel serene
with the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
or staring into space when you're feeling berserk

so jet to the store and buy the lp
on jive/rca cassettes and cd's
produced and arranged by the four-man crew
and oh shit skeff anselm he gets props too
make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers
so the new shit can rock from bronx to massapequa

so peace to that crew and peace to this crew

only way i'd be gettin' a g off was drug loot
and let's start it like this son rolling with this one and that one
pulling out gats for fun
but it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
started smoking woolas at sixteen
and running up in gates and doing hits for high stakes
making my way on fire escapes
no question i would speed for cracks and weed
the combination made my eyes bleed
no question i would flow off and try to get the dough all
sticking up white boys in ball courts
my life got no better same damn 'lo sweater
times is rough and tough like leather
figured out i went the wrong route

handcuffed in the back of a bus forty of us
life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough

living in the world no different from a cell

smoking bones in the staircase
though i don't know why i chose to smoke sess
i guess that's the time when i'm not depressed
but i'm still depressed and i ask what's it worth?
ready to give up so i seek the old earth
who explained working hard may help you maintain
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
we got stick-up kids corrupt cops and crack rocks
and stray shots all on the block that stays hot
leave it up to me while i be living proof

ejectin styles from my lethal weapon
my pen that rocks from here to oregon
here's mordigan catch it like a psycho flashback
i love gats if rap was a gun you wouldn't bust back
i come with shit in all types in shapes and sounds

to go and snatch up props all around the border
and get far like a shootin star

your empire falls and ya lose every cent

niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
this goes on in some companies
with majors they're scared to death to pump these
first of all who's your a&ampr?
a mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
but he don't know the meanin of dope
when he's lookin for a suit and tie rap

we was laughing at all the girls that passed
conversation brothers had began to discuss
hey yo ra remember that kid ya bust?
aw yeah he ran but he didn't get far
'cause i dropped him heh heh heh heh heh ha
not knowing exactly what lied ahead
my little brother my mother sent him out for bread
get the wonder it's a hot day in the summer
didn't expect to come across a crazy gunner
hey shorty check it for the bag and the dough
but he was brave looked him in the eye and said no
money splattered him bow then he snatched the bag
hit his pockets then he jetted up the ave
girls screaming the noise up and down the block
hey rakeem what? your little brother got shot
i ran frantically then i dropped down to his feet
i saw the blood all over the hot concrete
i picked him up then i held him by his head
his eyes shut that's when i knew he was
aw man how do i say goodbye?
it's always the good ones that have to die
memories in the corner of my mind
flashbacks i was laughing all the time
i taught him all about the bees and birds
but i wish i had a chance to sing these three words

wendy rene
after laughter comes tears
after your laughter there'll be tears

ghostface killa
me and my man my ace big moe from the shelter
'bout to hit the skins from this girl named thelma
now thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck
every girl from shaolin dissed her respect
we was stimmy you know how it is when you're blitzed
three o'clock in the morning something gots to give
moe said he'll go first i said i'll take next
here take this raincoat and practice safe sex
he seemed to ignore i said be for real
she's not even worth it to go raw deal
a man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
he got butt-naked and stuck the power u
twenty minutes went by moe i'm out without a doubt
i'm not pumping up i am airing out
hey yo he came out laughing with glory
i'm surprised he's still living to tell his story
but he carried on with the same old stuff
with stephanie like a whammy he pressed his luck
moe tried to be down with opp
ain't nothing wrong but he got caught with the hiv
now no life to live doc says two more years
so after the laughter i guess comes the tears

wendy rene
there'll be tears
after laughter comes tears

only way i'd be gettin' a g off was drug loot
and let's start it like this son rolling with this one and that one
pulling out gats for fun
but it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
started smoking woolas at sixteen
and running up in gates and doing hits for high stakes
making my way on fire escapes
no question i would speed for cracks and weed
the combination made my eyes bleed
no question i would flow off and try to get the dough all
sticking up white boys in ball courts
my life got no better same damn 'lo sweater
times is rough and tough like leather

i peep at the shape of the streets
and stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
a man with a dream with plans to make cream
which failed i went to jail at the age of fifteen
a young buck selling drugs and such who never had much
trying to get a clutch at what i could not touch
the court played me short now i face incarceration
pacin' going upstate's my destination
handcuffed in the back of a bus forty of us
life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
but as the world turns i learned life is hell
living in the world no different from a cell
every day i escape from jakes giving chase selling base
smoking bones in the staircase
though i don't know why i chose to smoke sess
i guess that's the time when i'm not depressed
but i'm still depressed and i ask what's it worth?
ready to give up so i seek the old earth
who explained working hard may help you maintain
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
we got stick-up kids corrupt cops and crack rocks
and stray shots all on the block that stays hot
leave it up to me while i be living proof
to kick the truth to the young black youth
but shorty's running wild smoking sess drinking beer

entice the price with the mic device
hit ya slice so precise that you never hurt twice
fierce how i pierce when you near the frontier

the overlord aboard with the two-edged sword
adored and restored now the young gun toward
preserve the herb never kick it to the curb
vocalize a verb and the return of the word
mecca the reincarnated selector
from the whole agenda something to remember
a richer voice than robin leach
i'll reach with a speech no bleach so you can't impeach

monumentally smooth i'll prove it sincerely

part of the plan is the man who built the land he began
a scripture ripped out the piece of a scroll
better the know yes a foretold the beautiful and bold

boogie to me i'll swallow hollow when you follow
stable like a turntable lyrics i cradle
no fable label or one my tongue around your navel
you're comin' to me so therefore the program's mecca

talkin' about the theoretical isometrical
alphabetical rebel a dissect-the-devil
unveil a tale in detail the third rail
read it in braille a bigger male leave a trail
now i sink you to the link that'll make you think
you's too large to shrink i need a drink
and toast to emperor mecca said to invent
to know of a child work your wiles so surrender
and never to be lobotomized the flexin' of the stanza
but you know the answer when i drop a proper grammar

and that's a fact baby
now you're gonna kick some lyrics
like this c'mon

walk the fine short line and put the needle to the grind
representin' one kind seeing eye for the blind
witness what i carry on bears a further purpose
from how we do slam a few then you want to purchase
a dialogue of funk you love to pop it in your trunk
i win more disciplined than a show-lin monk
pete rock and cl well set to spark it
the powerful target to destroy the black market
but when you say black listen i don't know you lose me
i guess another beggar can afford to be choosey
i come to the maximum artist on a major label
any duplication of this one is fatal
on one to five i gotta hit ya live
beat your ass with my tape any race or shape
'cause if they got mine they got yours too
but together here's what we gotta do

tell 'em straighten it out
ah yeah straighten it out
you know this is the word say what?straighten it out
that's right y'all straighten it out say what?
you got to straighten it out
everybody must straighten it out say what?
straighten it out yeah
straighten it out it's like that say what?

the funk legacy i pass on clearancy for high rates
every time we sample all the past time greats
stick it in the sp-1200 beat i make a loop
lovely where the troop in a lexus coupe
just a little bit set to make a whole lot happen
the musical inside my rappin'
written by the cl produced by the pr
and add in any credit that you heard thus far
i start from scratch 'cause the bass line's critical
better than the original who first made it
but now you want to sue me but fans never boo me
believe i know the times we been broke too g
here's another sample clear seeya get the hell outta here
like a bootleg you're over for the year
you'll only get the credit where the credit is due
so listen what i shout out is true

yeah true straighten it out
you gots to tell 'em to straighten it out
say what?straighten it out
you got to tell 'em to straighten it out
say what?straighten it out
that's right straighten it out
c'mon say what?straighten it out
that's right straighten it out
straighten it out say what?

like the strands of lamb's wool i'm thinkin' that's said
here to go to the head and count the locks on a dred
i and i'd 'mit to verify goin' to multiply
a theory many thought a conspiracy
here to let you know that it applies to all of us
you're no exceptions to the rule and that's a plus
'cause who jah bless let no one curse
straighten out what i be about reckon above the clout
and let the management work for me
because i don't need the unnecessary hostility
a proper marketing plan so we can gobble up the dough
straighten it out so everybody know
the kids are official with the purpose of a smooth surface
kickin' the service one time to make 'em nervous
we're finally here and very long overdue
pete rock this one's for the crew

you gotta straighten it out

in single parenthood there i stood
by the time she was 21 had another one
this one's a girl let's name her pam
same father as the first but you don't give a damn
irresponsible plain not thinking
papa said chill but the brother keep winking
still he won't down you or tear out your hide
on your side while the baby maker slide
but mama got wise to the game
the youngest of five kids hon here it is
after 10 years without no spouse
momma's gettin' married in the house

verse two

cl

when i date back i recall a man off the family tree
my right hand poppa doc i see
took me from a boy to a man so i always had a father
when my biological didn't bother
taking care of this so who am i to bicker
not a bad ticker but i'm clocking pop's liver
but you can never say that his life is through
5 kids at 21 believe he got a right too
here we go while i check the scene
with the portuguese lover at the age of 14
the same age front page no fuss
but i bet you all your dough they live longer than us
never been senile that's where you're wrong
but give the man a taste and he's gone
noddin off sleep to a jazz tune
i can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
i get the pillow and hope i don't wake him
for this man do cuss hear it all in verbatim
telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
i said pop maybe when you're older
we laughed all night about the hookers at the party
my old man standing yelling good god almighty
use your condom take sips of the brew
when they reminisce over you for real

pete rock

for real baby
like that
we for real
comin' atcha
in '92
pete rock and cl smooth
yeah c'mon hit me


verse three

cl

i reminisce so you never forget this
the days of wayback so many bear witness the fitness
take the first letter out of each word in this joint
listen close as i prove my point
t to the r-uh-o-y how did you and i meet?
in front of big lou's fighting in the street
but only you saw what took many time to see
i dedicate this to you for believing in me
rain or shine yes in any weather
my grandmom pam holds the family together
my uncle doc's the greatest better yet the latest
if we're talking about a car uncle sterling got the latest
i strive to be live 'cause i got no choice
and run my own business like my aunt joyce
so pete rock hit me nuff respect due
when they reminisce over you listen

pete rock

listen just listen
to the funky song as i rock on
and that's word is bond
i'm not playin'
everybody just coolin
this song we dedicate
to the one and only
never be another
he was my brother
trouble t-roy
it's like that y'all
and you don't stop
pete rock and cl smooth for '92
and we out later",2
10,"cl smooth
the nightcap was exiled steadily profiled
as the underachievin non-believin can't stand to reason
where's your daddy boy - to categorize the drinker
misunderstood to make the ordeal linger
they label me a problem child who can't cope
hangin' by a thread yes a very thin rope
inevitably can never be the man can i tell ya
visualize and memorize him in a cellar
well tally-ho pip-pip my fam's gonna catch a fit
my father lookin' like he wanna bust my lip
but that was never good for my health
so i take the shovel out my pocket and dig myself
now when i look at the man in the mirror
i see things much more clearer my lord
i'm not that popular less than a dollar
but the ? i pack can make you holla

 pete rock scratches various on and on samples 

cl smooth
i said what you don't know could make a whole new world
man listen i'm set to sabotage premonition
your propaganda crooked type of version
some of the things i bring you're babblin non-person
imbedded in my character rebel nostalgia
uncommon valor who'd rather
have no man-made religion or sect
but try to believe what you conceive may be half correct
i shed light to show the path in sight
cause a man who can't treat you right can't teach you right
in front of your eyes what a surprise and let the nature
rise just for the girls and the guys
a phi-slamma-jamma when you wear a bandanna
peace to pop dukes and long live nana
the formula's reality pete rock's the storm
together forever yes g we got it goin' on

 pete rock scratches various on and on samples 

cl smooth
internal affairs flippin hollywood squares
in search of the mecca many travel in pairs
walked the slave ship ??the side of ningamora??
to support a short order when i freak it on a corner
five-oh cruisin decide to pull you over
beefin where's the coke? i said a six-pack of soda?
the rookie's lookin' thirsty but everything's mental
a baseball bat to smack shirley in the temple
agreed to meet the maker so i yelled hail mary's
and flew that head to hit the house on the prairie
but the past can never choose my future correctly
i found a greater source directly
on and on keep it on you chant the
boppin simonized pullin you clockwise jammie
to quickly skip the minimal tip i dap for the wise i dip
can anyone see phenomenally to the last degree?
i capitalize subliminally wreck for positivity
yes my little chickadee ready to flow with me
nevertheless i bless follow me and see
predominantly cl'll be all in the family
god bless marky black know we go way back
the lyrics i pack is like a needle in the haystack
cl and pete rock smooth like dom perignon
never torn word is bond we got it goin' on

 pete rock scratches various on and on samples to fade ",2
11,"prepare yourself to catch a verse from the big purse
rotate the megahertz where you heard it first
the perpendicular said none similar
quadruple any figure quick on the trigger
helter skelter wig out by the goodfella
not lou pinella 'cause i'm black and mo' betta
bust a phenomenum we come to get busy
deep in roots but my name ain't kizzie
many many march 'cause i'm heavy on the starch
never tell a farce when i scale on a arch
jammin' on the radio brothers say way to go
shape it like play-do soprano at the chateau
my theory periodically flows a odyssey
bigger than modern technology
so save all the chit-chat when i kick a format fat
it's like that

cl is the attribute you salute
'cause i gotta make loot can't afford to be cute
enter the equilibrium in a medium
breaking your cranium with no ultimatum
drop a psalm like a bomb never land in your palm
and now i'm so cool and calm
pure unadulterated premeditated
lyrical form pete rock is the storm
sophistication i kick to a nation
i rare compilation i call recreation
the prognosis so mackadocious
straight up ferocious for those who can focus
large like the beatles ask all my peoples
never make movies so don't talk sequels
so hon save the chit-chat when i kick a format fat it's fat
it's like that

i'm all sold out no doubt without a question
the blessing your guests in a suprucated session
anyway your honor heresay the melee
is here for the payday so a to the k
or should i say deda original baby par
smooth like a reservoir the funky shang-ri-la
no shame in my game i'm set to entertain
and if it wasn't for the fame skinz would never know my name
so back off a tad bit that's a bad habit
'cause i write the raw for sure
now i'm a flip a style and get crazy versatile
never fragile 'cause i'm flowin' like the nile
swing a jewel or a gem notice how i say them
with my approach smoke a rhyme to a roach
a four-season lover light-skinned and bigger
but what i deliver come before the cotton picker
so here's to another hit perfectly legitimate
when i hit the skinz guaranteed to keep the candle lit
so save all the chit-chat when i kick a format fat
it's like that",2
12,"ah yeah yes
psychedelic
uh come on
this is what i like
it's that pete rock and cl smooth stuff
uh huh yeah
brothers can't understand
you know i'm about to drop a funky beat on you
like this


hit the war drums that vibrate the earth underneath
here my people and i come gotta wake up the chief
not a pale frail ghost cl'll wreck the most
'cause the mecca land never had a leo africanos
the sudanian master of the mediterranean
and if it's lovely i'm the one you're skypagin'
lower than the mole man r&ampb you're silly
the only male hardcore crusin' through my city
rise to the supernova swami like bola
heavy hitter i consider ueuker leanin' on my shoulder
measure like a yardstick thick at arithmetic
you add it up and i roast a high pick flick
hit the pitch and then i'm gone as the funk lingers on
i don't publicize here to keep the black race torn
but steady at an altitude where you get the mental food
not to be rude here's a fresh pot brewed
oh what a web we weave when we practice to deceive
sparkin' off a trick up the sleave
pete stocked the bedrock listen and you'll see
and i'm sure you will agree you can't front on me

yo you can't front
it's like that c'mon yeah
yes you know i got to talk
you can't front
i'm tellin' you now
cl smooth and the rock c'mon

many consumed what was locked in a tomb
that i gradually groomed coming out now smelling like perfume
so take a whiff when i wrap a gift play ya like a gospel
a logical apostle colossal whoooweee
afro a cut me like a fade with a braun
sport a bald head but never needed hair club for men
drop a scud fully-capable a form in a eclipse
skips to backflips soon as it leaves my lips
suave know i can make the funk turn the habit
kick the old 45 and i can boogie on static
welcome to the brahma don pilgrimage to mecca don
a prayer for the parish soucron affwaun
'cause ain't no misbehavin' when they manage what you're cravin'
put the anger in the nation on your station
anvils that fills the whole circumference
and black people crowd in a mass abundance
to hear gabriel's horn blow it like a naiji
what's the flavor unit with the top priority?
cl untouchable with the clip full
impossibly the posse can't front on me

don't you dare front
don't you dare front
not on me
'cause i'm the man
cl's the rhymer
right on time
right on my brother
come on kick another verse for me

you desire the messiah for the entire empire
total organizer of the earth wind and fire
cl and pete rock unlock the hard rock
many want to mock and the honey-dips clock
intercontinental for the residential
never coincidental rough on a rental
count all the bars numeric
pro-prosthetic if ya let it resurrect the nongeneric
the brother on the cover yes a rapper not a singer
if you recognize him point with your index finger
shock another flock when i hit the block
god or devil on the set that's level labeled as a rebel
in retrospect i detect those incorrect
and reflect the black power project
supreme 'cause i chose to never blaspheme
going to the extreme place it on a very high beam
and drop jewels for five thousand fools who stampede
'cause the proper show stopper's what ya need
so come and get a taste of the dynamic duo
and i'm sure you will agree you can't front on me yoooo

you can't front boy
'cause we're the skilled fools skibooze?
we'z are the funk
the hardcore funk
we ain't no joke
comin' out to note
ah yeah
with the funk track
sing it p",2
13,"pete rock

and my man cl smooth kick it for you like this

cl smooth
from the heights not what am i write simple i can do this
like popeye to brutus i'm your host like a stewardess
fly with the neighborhood hi-jackin fella
so prepare for landing and crash into a cellar
bodies in the buddha cloud misty in the tune
like a show all nights a figure eight in a lagoon
with pete rock the complete lock and beat stop
now all the horny heffers wanna dangle on my errr
down by the dungeon with the cracks on the wall
buffoon i'm like a mink while you're soon to pimp a raccoon stole
vocal arrangement ready set to hit the pavement
but not before the kid leave the basement

pete rock
the basement put the funk in grand
here comes my man
my brother grap lover get wreck cousin c'mon

grap lover
call me the grap lover yes the younger soul brother
keep your eyes on the prize cause you won't find another
when the funk is played the rhyme i display
quick to bust a ditz so don't slip in the way
of the kid with the flavor the party people saviour
clockin all the honies eyes sharp like a razor
i kick a dance step you're soon to discover
yo that's the kid from mecca and the soul brother
yeah once in a while i be with cl on the dl
or i flow with pete and find my placement in the basement

to see a black man gettin' paid on the regular
car with the cellular fellas i'm tellin' ya

peace signin off check one two straight from the basement

pete rock
straight from the basement
i'm tellin' you now kid
it's crazy fat
i wonder who this is comin' up?

fourth but not least the backbone of the wig out
freestyle crazy hardcore no sellout
speakin' upon where i dwell from the dungeon
all over the us states even london
pasttime present black to the future
swimmin in beats like a dolphin so call me don shula
a raider well like art shell crazy defense
a pro bowl with soul for local events
the crew name is cl smooth and pete rock
here to sail when i prevail and stare into the dock
the pimp daddy of the funk flavor catch you later
clever like a secret agent comin' from the basement

that's right crazy funky
aww my man
he's crazy funky his name is rob-o check him out

rob-o
ali-kazaam you'll never guess what i am
motto is that nothin' ever changes but haircuts and kicks
to stacks of vocal breaks life pays when
kid said pete makes beats in the basement
cold hit the pavement over to the chill side
the real side the 7-7 hillside
i thought i'd just chill take a breath
straight up columbus hill make a left
and get fixed plus the ghetto chicks got flicks
of me stacks of kicks my joint's bumpin lovely
walkin' down the street much props on the?
i hear voices sayin' that's rob-o'dingo in the basement

pete rock
ah ha ha ha hah yeah this is funky
i can feel it
my man from the vernon his name is di-da make it raw

dida
fly like an eagle a seagull
always into somethin' like snoopy the beagle
people grab a tight hold of the sound
hard snatchin raw papes off the shelves
blowin' up spots from state to state
i'm comin' to town but you just can't wait
check the station for conversation at six-block
uno here to put suckers in the mix
i get deeper than oceanography
thinkin' of crazy shit like psychology
so speak the piece then slide like grease
the beat is fat but the rhyme is obese in the basement

pete rock
in the basement is where i dwell
check the mc's swell
'cause i am crazy funky with cl smooth
my man ? rob-o g-r baby pah
the heavster my brother grap lover
everybody fades out can't hear it",2
14,"cl smooth
above the level of a mezzanine healthy as ovaltine
the dominant ? clean i mean go the light's green
the protege could play like chess to quest the best
confess never poor as bangladesh
i get busy like a boxer operate like a doctor
seal like a locker pop like orville redenbacher
buy the tape lp cd
all me and petey to cater to the needy
like a prayer for madonna but a different world for jasmine
cl is well a physical attraction
let me make myself perfectly clear
while i'm there i make a peer a positive pap smear
really i do once i light the barbeque
thread the loose ends see my friends are the crew
the fright night king of new york like frank white
if it ain't rough it ain't right man listen

cl smooth
if it ain't rough enough to mingle in the stuff
to scar and scuff and make you cuckoo like a cocoa puff
it ain't right so i smash the satellite
check the farenheight before i take flight
unique as mozambique here to freak sheik
the skills that won't leak and never antique
warm like a oven you're lovin' the style i'm druggin
alleyway muggin heavyweight sluggin
no fibs i kick the ad libs and rock it in the cribs
break your ribs like a toothpick cause you were never slick
? you lacked back when i first started
cl's the one who got the red sea parted
my conversation qualification is a doozy
the rude rudy wreckin write you off as a floozy
i shoot for the moon but even if i miss
i'm among the stars to put a bullethole in mars

cl smooth
in my frame of mind i design the best-seller
for rougher cats can rockafeller you're penn and teller
steady with the convo rought like brillo
let your head hit the bed and knock the feathers out your pillow
the master intelligent with the black testament
found it relevant and mailed it to the president
but overall i get papes for my labor
with the physical manifestation of a saviour
you wanna test this but i slay anyway
cause your rhymes are old with more wrinkles than a charpei
mecca don upon the streets of babylon
pass the baton to respond like farrakhan
hard like shaft with the staff for the backdraft
a blazin' aftermath so hon make a path
if you don't trust him bust him
but if you don't have a weapon then kid keep steppin
the main idea in here for the hemisphere
cl's here to get wreck for the year
a large man's appetite blowin' like dynamite

february 1st 1975 it happened
was born in west savannah way before i started rappin'
my mama had a nigga at the age of fifteen
my daddy was sellin' that sack now he's gots responsibilities

stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
and she couldn't watch my every move so shit i started servin'
around frazier home down in the west side projects
changin' over foodstamps and hittin a lick was next see

i'm just a playa like that my jeans was sharply creased
i got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed east
so flyin' or floatin' a brougham is what i'm sportin'
sade is in my tape deck i'm movin in slow motion boi

so meet me deep in the streets that's where i learned the capers
us lickin blunts lickin leaves rollin' reefer papers
i'm slightly slouched in the seats off in my bucket
but the niggas around the ave and the hoes they love me

they wanna be me and my family too
because the money that i make be puttin' cable off in every room
so follow the beans follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
it's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me

but go 'head on with that foolishness bitch
let me get lovely with my swerve because i'm true to this shit
and if you comin with eight dollars you shit out of luck
because the west side ain't takin no shorts on the dime
so fire it up

been wearin furry kangol's so that shit is old

you might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
five dollars for a table dance so now your money's spent
you listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
as long as there's that tic tic followed by that bump

i'm down to stick a hoe if she got a g-strang
'cause the niggaz in the pointe ain't changed man
you might call us country but we's only southern
and i don't give a fuck p-funk spot to spark another

now now now nine in my hand ounce in my crotch
diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch mmhmm

let's party till we can't no more
watch out here come the folks
damn ooh lord

as the plot thickens it gives me the dickens
reminiscent of charles a li'l discoteque nestled in the ghettos
of niggaville usa via atlanta georgia
a li'l spot where young men and young women go to experience
they first li'l taste of nightlife

me? well i've never been there well perhaps once
but i was so engulfed in the e 
i never made it to the door you speak of hard core
while the dj sweating out all the problems and troubles of the day
while this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
competing with set it off in the right
but it all blends perfectly let the liquor tell it 

hey hey look baby they playin' our song
and the crowd goes wild as if holyfield has just won the fight
but in actuality it's only about 300 am 
and three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance sliced up
two niggas done start bustin' wham wham
and one nigga done took his shirt off talkin' bout 
now who else wanna fuck with hollywood cole?
it's just my interpretation of the situation

yes when i first met my spottieottiedopaliscious angel
i can remember that damn thang like yesterday
the way she moved remined me of a brown stallion horse with skates on you know
smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair

i walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrup
eyes beaming like four carats apiece just blinding a nigga
felt like i chiefed a whole o of that presidential
my heart was beating so damn fast

never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
funny how shit come together sometimes ya dig
one moment you frequent the booty clubs and the next four years 
you and somebody's daughter rising y'all own young'n 

now that's a beautiful thang that's if you're on top of your game
and man enough to handle real life situations that is
can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money 
might not always be sufficient

but the united parcel service and the people at the post office
didn't call you back because you got cloudy piss
so now you back in the trap just that trapped
go and marinate on that for a minute",2

and i'm out

baboon on your back but what's sad is that crack
was introduced to hispanic communities and blacks

but then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
'cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
maybe your son tried it rehab too crowded

niggaz hang around 'cause of who you are
you get a lot of love 'cause of what you got
they say they're happy for you but they're really not

sell a lot of records and you roll a benz
fall up in the spot now you losing friends
all you want to do is give the world your heart
record label try to make you compromise your art

you make a million dollars make a million mo'
first class broad treats you like a nigga po'
you want to say wait but you're scared to ask
as your world starts spinning and it's moving fast

trying to stay sane that's the price of fame
spending your life trying to numb the pain
you shake that load off and sing your song
liberate the minds then you go on home

i must admit they planted a lot of thangs
in the brains and the veins of my strain
makes it hard to refrain from the host of cocaine
from them whores from the flame
from a post in the game
makes it hard to maintain focus

then from the glock rounds and lockdowns and burials
the seeds that sewed get devoured by the same locust
'cause it's a hard row to hoe
if your ass don't move and the rain don't fall
and the ground is dry
but the roots are strong so some survive
to you surprise now i voice their cries

you got more juice than zeus
slanging lightning trying to frighten
plain dwellers of the serengeti
but get beheaded when you're falsely dreaded
melanin silicone and collagen injected
dissected my pride who's the one gone get it started
we be the lionhearted without infanticide
it's like that red sprite you can't imagine it

unless you're looking at the canvas of life
and not through the peephole of mortality
single-minded mentality
getting over on loopholes
getting paid twofold on technicalities
clicking your heels scared to voice how you feel
packing steel

picking cotton from the killing fields with no total
i don't thank we in kansas no more though
midwest or dirty south
clean dressed or dirty mouth
whether robbing preachers or killing poor righteous teachers

your scared demon
shouldn't be allowed to spread semen
and you cowardly lions never defying the jackals of babble
running with their pack tail between your legs
though the man on your head says the story though
as you downplay your glory
cackling help the shackling of your brethren happen
just by rapping
liberator",2

remember back in the days when niggaz had waves
gazelle shades and corn braids
pitchin pennies honies had the high top jellies
shootin skelly motherfuckers was all friendly
loungin at the barbeques drinkin' brews
with the neighborhood crews hangin' on the avenues
turn your pagers to nineteen ninety three
niggaz is gettin' smoked g believe me
talk slick you get your neck slit quick
cause real street niggaz ain't havin' that shit
totin techs for rep smokin' blunts in the project
hallways shootin dice all day
wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit
we get hype and shit and start lifin shit
so step away with your fist fight ways
motherfucker this ain't back in the days but you don't hear me though

verse two

no more cocoa leave-io one two three
one two three all of this to me is a mystery
i hear you motherfuckers talk about it
but i stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it
and i'm down with the shit too
for the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use kung-fu
instead of a mac-10 he tried scrappin
slugs in his back and that's what the fuck happens
when you sleep on the street
little motherfuckers with heat want ta leave a nigga six feet deep
and we comin' to the wake
to make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake
back in the days our parents used to take care of us
look at 'em now they even fuckin' scared of us
callin the city for help because they can't maintain
damn shit done changed

verse three

if i wasn't in the rap game
i'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
because the streets is a short stop
either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
shit it's hard being young from the slums
eatin five cent gums not knowin' where your meals comin' from
and now the shit's gettin' crazier and major
kids younger than me they got the sky grand pagers
goin' outta town blowin' up
six months later all the dead bodies showin up
it make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie
but i gotta go identify the body
damn what happened to the summertime cookouts?
everytime i turn around a nigga gettin' took out
shit my momma got cancer in her breast

packed up my tools for my raw power move
glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin' to stop my flow
and what they don't know will show on the autopsy
went to see papi to cop me a brick
asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin' to hear it

and my bitch swear to god she won't snitch

answers to this quizzin'
to the brothers in the streetschools and the prisons
history shouldn't be a mystery

they teach ya like an ace they ain't be betrayed
a no-use number with no-use people
if your life is on the line then you're dead today
late comings with the late comin' stretcher
that's a body bag in disguise y'all i betcha
i call 'em body snatchers 'cause they come to fetch ya
with an autopsy ambulance just to dissect ya
they are the kings 'cause they swing amputation
lose your arms your legs to them it's compilation
i can prove it to you watch the rotation
it all adds up to a funky situation

so get up-a get get get down
9-1-1 is a joke in yo' town
get up-a get get get down
late 9-1-1 wears the late crown

9-1-1 is a joke x2

everyday they don't never come correct

he would've been in full 8 9-1-1
was a joke 'cause they' always jokin'
they the token to your life when it's croakin'
they need to be in a pawn shop on a
9-1-1 is a joke we don't want 'em
i call a cab 'cause a cab will come quicker
the doctors huddle up and call a flea ficker
the reason that i say that 'cause they
flick you off like fleas
they be laughin' at ya while you're crawlin' on your knees
and to the strength so go the length
thinkin' you are first when you really are tenth

i refuse to lose
here's your ticket

the crew to you to push the back to black

ways to blaze your brain and train ya
the way i'm livin' forgiven'
what i'm givin' up
x on the flex hit me now
i don't know about later
as for now i know how to avoid the paranoid
man i've had it up to here
gear i wear got 'em goin' in fear
rhetoric said
read just a bit ago
not quittin' though
signed the hard rhymer
work to keep from gettin' jerked
changin' some ways
to way back in the better days
raw metaphysically bold
never followed a code
still dropped a load
never question what i am god knows
'cause it's comin' from the heart
what i got better get some
get on up hustler of culture
snakebitten
been spit in the face
but the rhymes keep fittin'
respects been givin' how's ya livin'
now i can't protect a pad off defect
check the record
an reckon an intentional wreck
played off as some intellect
made the call took the fall
broke the laws
not my fault they're fallin' off
known as fair square
throughout my years
so i growl at the livin' foul
black to the bone my home is your home
so welcome to the terrordome
subordinate terror
kickin' off an era
cold deliverin' pain
my 98 was 87 on a record yo
so now i go bronco

crucifixion ain't no fiction
so called chosen frozen
apology made to who ever pleases
still they got me like jesus
i rather sing bring think reminisce
'bout a brother while i'm in sync
every brother ain't a brother cause a color
just as well could be undercover
backstabbed grabbed a flag
from the back of the lab
told a rab get off the rag
sad to say i got sold down the river
still some quiver when i deliver
never to say i never know or had a clue
word was heard plus hard on the boulevard
lies scandalizin' basin'
traits of hate who's celebratin' wit satan?
i rope a dope the evil with righteous
bobbin' and weavin' and let the good get even
c'mon down
and welcome to the terrordome
caught in the race against time
the pit and the pendulum
check the rhythm and rhymes
while i'm bendin' 'em
snakes blowin' up the lines of design
tryin' to blind the science i'm snedin' 'em
how to fight the power
cannot run and hide
but it shouldn't be suicide
in a game a fool without the rules
got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
every brother ain't a brother
cause a black hand
squeezed on malcolm x the man
the shootin' of huey newton
from a hand of a nigger who pulled the trigger

it's weak to speak and blame somebody else
when you destroy yourself
first nothing's worse than a mother's pain
of a son slain in bensonhurst
can't wait for the state to decide the fate
so this jam i dedicate
places with racist faces
just an example of one of many cases
the greek weekend speech i speak
from a lesson learned in virginia beach
i don't smile in the line of fire
i go wildin'
but it's on bass and drums even violins
watcha do gitcha head ready
instead of gettin' physically sweaty
when i get mad
i put it down on a pad
give ya somethin' that cha never had controllin'
fear of high rollin'
god bless your soul and keep livin'
never allowed kickin' it loud
droppin' a bomb
brain game intellectual vietnam
move as a team
never move alone

and now every time
she turns around
all the people in the neighborhood
look and get mad and sing

meet mr succesful
i guess he's blessed yeah
but he happens to be a brother
who only wants blue eyes and blonde hair
now this young mister
he don't like sisters
he couldn't find that special one
he know why he missed her
he says sisters wasn't good enuff
they only wanted his green stuff
that's why every time he turned
around all the people
in the neighborhood
looked and got mad
and sang

i try to tell my people
there should not be any hatred
for a brother or a sister
whose opposite race they've mated
no man is god
and god put us all here yeah
but this system has no wisdom
the devil split us in pairs
and taught us white is good black is bad

all the people in my neighborhood
look mad and sing",2
7,"when i'm talkin' rhyme time
to blow your mind time some say
it's nothing worse than a verse

try to never back pedal
from the power some got
to get a nigger shot

once they never gave a fuck about
what i said
now they listen and they want my head

instead of peace the police
just wanna wreck and flex
on the kid
what i did was try to be the best
so they fingered the trigger
figured i was a bigger nigger
and started to search
an so i headed west
went to cally a rally
was for a brothers death
it was the fuzz who shot him
an not da blood or cuzz
i wondered why it was like
so i just held my mike
but in my mind i was blind

big daddy kane

as i walk the streets of hollywood boulevard
thinin' how hard it was to those that starred
in the movies portrayin' the roles
of butlers and maids slaves and hoes
many intelligent black men seemed to look uncivilized
when on the screen
like a guess i figure you to play some jigaboo
on the plantation what else can a nigger do
and black women in this profession
as for playin' a lawyer out of the question
for what they play aunt jemima is the perfect term
even if now she got a perm
so let's make our own movies like spike lee

there's nothing that the black man could use to earn

how the hell can a color be no good for a neighborhood

without solutions
all the dancers answer questions
and try to be the best and
let everybody know before i blow
for the sake of what's right
i wanna know who stole the soul?

we choose to use their ways
and holidays notice some of them are heller days
invented by those who never repented
for the sins within that killed my kin

day to day america eats it's young
and defeats our women
there is a gap so wide we all can swim in
drown in uh get down an get it
got it goin' on wit it
sister hey soul sister
we goin' be all right
it takes a man to take a stand
understand it takes a
woman to make a stronger man
as we both get strong

i can't hold back
so i get exact on a track
it's an eye for eye tooth for tooth
forget about me

and make 'em all say
damn this generation

they don't know what we got goin' is sound
to turn it all around
to my sisters i communicate
with the bass and tone
through speakers and a microphone
'cause i'm tired of america dissin' my sisters
for example like they dissed tawana
and they try to say she's a liar
my people don't believe it
but even now they're getting higher
of the feeling inspiration
we must know that in this nation
every single generation
they teach us how to dis our sisters
stange as you say i say revolution
need for change brings on revolution
the great book look see solution
god chooses what and who for the bruisin'
there's been no justice for none of my sisters
just us been the ones that's been missin' her
now we got to protect
and get together and damn this generation

i said so to what it is
where it is
she needs a little respect
there it is
i would say she needs a lotta
brother from a mother like me has gotta
give it up
give it now
and pass it all around
to my soul sister

they disrespected mama and treated her like dirt
america took her reshaped her raped her
no it never made the paper
beat us mated us
made us attack our woman in black
so i said sophisticated b don't be one
not to heed the warning crack of dawn
or is it the dawn of crack? uh oh
stop the talk they say but
we talk and say what's right or wrong
some say we wasting time singing a song
but why is it there were many different shades?
black woman's privacy invaded years and years
you cannot count my mama's tears
it's not the past the future's what she fears
strong we be strong
the next generation
it's not what/who we're facin'
the finger's pointed to us in our direction
the blind state of mind needs correction
word to the mother we tighten connection
to be a man you need no election
this generation generates a new attitude
sister to you we should not be rude

tip educateem my rhymes are strictly taboo
fill 'em with some fantasies and i'll look out like tattoo

q-tip

okay
i am recognizing that the voice inside my head
is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else
because opinions are like voices
we all have a different kind
so just clean out all of your ears
these are my views and you will find that
we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
the ghetto vocalist is on a state-wide tear
soon to be the continent and then the freakin globe
there's room for it all as we mingle at the ball
we welcome competion 'cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn
we gotta work hard you know the damn card
try to be the fattest is the level that we strive
try to be the fattest also to stay alive",2

so parlay while i drop this rhyme

see jake be gettin' illy when the sun get dark
they be comin' out the heads but shit don't let me start
their activities are plenty in nighttime nighttime
for the ghetto child it seems to be the right time
see kids be gettin' stuck with jewels and fly gimmicks
shorty see the action and then start to mimic
runnin' to the corner the dice game is blazin'
lookin' at the loot it seems so amazin
puts it short down to be exact would bound
he shakes the stones in his hand then he lets it down uh
scam money don't make none
he threw a trip on the ace now he's out son
hits the local bodega to woof down a hero
son is on a 'midnight run' like de niro
spots the shorty rock standin on his block
the thieves be handlin in the pumps so he asked it it's not
conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one
increased intensity his dance sure was a fly one
took her to the crib there she ran her gibs
about mind upliftment and bein positive
he yawned and he sighed till 105
then he finally realized that hunny wasn't live
at least he didn't plan on buildin for the evenin'
threw the fila on the dome and said 'come on yo we leavin'
came out on the scene as he told her to beep him
saw his man sam with the blunt in his hand
aww shhh you know the transaction
brothas gettin' lost in the weed satisfaction
comin' down the block man loud as fuck
you would swear redman was inside the trunk
as the night seemed darker cops is on a hunt
they interrupt ya cipher and crush ya blunt
see you left your work at home so they pat you down for nothin'
why in the hell does 10-4 keep frontin?
you push to the park even though it's still dark
the kid is nice on the hoop he said 'i'll spot ya troop'

the night is on my mind
the sun'll still shine
but now the night is on my mind the night is on the mind
the night is on your mind
a yo the sun'll still shine
but now the night is on the mind
as for me

i'm a nocturnal animal god concentrates
on a young black man who makes the niggaz speak a shake
the nighttime is busy it's word to aunt kizzy
it's the time we get down yo son you know the sound
the flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it
the night makes the aura and the j can't hack it
the way the moon dangles in the midnight sky
and the stars dance around a yo i think it's fly
intensity most rappers don't see it
spirit wise musically you gotta be it
serenity and sirens of the sounds and emotions
in the concrete jungle and the sun don't bungle
i think it's hard to find the words on how i feel
i paid about a deuce twenty for the ampex steel
but let me slow down i think i ran my gibs enough
peace out to the nation stay rugged and rough

how can a reverend preach when a rev can't define

we rap about what we see meaning reality
from people bustin' caps and like mandela bein free
not every mc be with the negativity

a tribe called quest we on the run for whatever
trials and tribulations that we have to endeavor
brothers know my steelo it's a letter to the better
if you see a shorty that you like then you sweat her
silly with the microphone in other words i'm loco
six foot zero with my height complexion cocoa
representin on the mic it seems to be my daily
i can do a split and turn around like alvin ailey
but when it comes to days like this i got lyrics to go

lyrics to go it's like that y'all c'mon y'all
lyrics to go it's like that

phife dawg
i know it's been two years but see the tribe was never fallin'
would have tried for singin' but that stuff was not my callin
the mic is in effect so you know i'm never stallin
walkin' through the door and all them suckers started haulin
talk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it
pull out your microphone and watch the phifer make you eat it
the mc's they get jealy when the girly's on my belly
kick a slow dance like my brother r kelly bust a rhyme
today's a hip-hop draft will i be top-seeded? uh
worked too frickin hard while all the rest were gettin' weeded
steady kickin styles so i can reach that other level uh
don't worry about gettin' gassed i push the pedal to the metal
always wanted this cause it surely beats a scramble right
i'm jordan with the mic huh wanna gamble? mmm
this i dedicate to all the honiest that be bogle-in
cause at the end of the night y'know malik will have his trojans

formulate your rhymes like a child forms play-doh right
calm and serene like the study was tayo
poetry machine with correct mechanisms
immune to disease i defeat organisms
that are waitin in my path i overstep the critters
give your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters uh
winners turn to losers losers are forgotten
tangle in my fore with hopes that i stop rockin'
never will that happen only if it is permitted uh
wait i think somebody shitted c'mon
i guess that will be me 'cause i'm the only one mcin

good evening sirens in the background
i'm reporting live from sunset boulevard
where many excited fans have gathered with candles
crowd starts chanting tupac
awaiting the much anticipated release of tupac shakur's latest album better dayz
this is yet another post-humorous release by tupac
which raises the question
where are these songs coming from?
it's interesting how the message in these songs
is still relevant today
even in his death he's touching people with his lyrics
i can feel the energy in the air as they count down to midnight
when the album will officially be released
oh hold on i think they're starting to countdown now

a soldier dies but once

they say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
puffin weed as i position myself to clock g's
my enemies scatter in suicidal situations
never to witness the wicked shit that they was facing
pockets is packed with presidents pursue your riches
evading the player hating tricks while hitting switches
bitches is bad-mouth cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
but y'all some hoes the game should be sewed
i'm sick of psychotic society somebody save me
addicted to drama so even mama couldn't raise me
even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
i run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps
i'm ducking the cop i hit the weed as i'm clutching my glock
niggas is hot when i hit the block what if i die tonight

if i die tonight
if i die tonight
if i die tonight
tonight's the night i get in some shit

polishing pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
when i get to popping niggas is dropping then they done
calling the coroner come collect the fucking corpse
he got it by killer preoccupied with being boss
revenge is the method whenever stepping keep a weapon close
adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
hit the block and fill your pockets making crack sales
picture perfection pursuing paper with a passion
visions of prisons for all the pussies that i blasted
running with criminals individuals with no remorse
try to stop me my pistol posse's using deadly force
in my brain all i can think about is fame
the police know my name a different game ain't a thing changed
i'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
conversatin' like they still here if i die tonight


pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
pray to the heavens three-fifty-sevens to the sky
and i hope i'm forgiven for thug living when i die
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
a stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a player
overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when i lay her
pistol whipping these simps for being petrified and lame
disrespecting the game praying for punishment and pain
going insane never die live eternal who shall i fear?
don't shed a tear for me nigga i ain't happy here
i hope they bury me and send me to my rest
headlines reading murdered to death my last breath
take a look picture a crook on his last stand
motherfuckers don't understand if i die tonight

can you picture my prophecy?
stress in the city the cops is hot for me
the projects is full of bullets the bodies is droppin'
there ain't no stoppin' me
constantly movin while makin' millions

addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin
without feelin' but will they last or be blasted?
hard headed bastard
maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
more bodies being buried -- i'm losing my homies in a hurry
they're relocating to the cemetery
got me worried stressin my vision's blurried
the question is will i live? no one in the world loves me
i'm headed for danger don't trust strangers
put one in the chamber whenever i'm feelin' this anger
don't wanna make excuses cause this is how it is
what's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth

veteran a villain a young thug who one day shall fall

everday there's mo'death and plus i'm dough-less

verse three 2pac

with all this extra stressin
the question i wonder is after death after my last breath
when will i finally get to rest? through this supression
they punish the people that's askin questions
and those that possess steal from the ones without possesions
the message i stress to make it stop study your lessons
don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
be grateful for blessings
don't ever change keep your essence
the power is in the people and politics we address
always do your best don't let the pressure make you panic
and when you get stranded
and things don't go the way you planned it
dreamin' of riches in a position of makin' a difference
politicians and hypocrites they don't wanna listen
if i'm insane it's the fame made a brother change
it wasn't nuttin like the game
it's just me against the world

though i walk through tha valley of death
i shed so many tears
please god walk with me

back in elementry i thrived on misery
left me alone i grew up amongst a dying breed
inside mind couldn't find a place ta rest
until i got that thug life tatted on my chest
tell me can ya feel me?
i'm not liven in tha past you wanna last
be tha first ta blast remember kato
no longer with us he's deseased
call on tha sirens i seem him murdered in tha streets
now rest in peace
is there heaven for a 'g' ?
remember me so many homies in the cemetery
shed so many tears


lord
i suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears
lord
i lost so many peers and shed so many tears

now that i'm strugglin' in this business
by any means label me greedy gettin' green
but seldom seen
and fuck tha world 'cause i'm cursed
i'm havin' visions of leaven here in a hurse
god can ya feel me?
take me away from all tha pressure and all tha pain
show me some happiness again
i'm goin' blind
i spend my time in this cell ain't livin' well
i know my destiny is hell where did i fail?
my life is in denial
and when i die babtised in eternal fire
shed so many tears


lord
i suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears
lord
i lost so many peers and shed so many tears

now i'm lost and i'm weary
so many tears i'm suicidal so don't stand near me
my every move is a compilated step
ta bring me closer
to embrace an early death now there's nothing left
there was no mercy on tha streets
i couldn't rest
i'm barely standing bout to go to pieces screaming peace
and though my soul was deleted i couldn't see it
i had my mind full of demons tryin' ta break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparking tha flame
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
no memories just misery
painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep
will i survive till tha morning ta see tha sun
please lord forgive me for my sins
cause here i come


lord
i suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears
god
i lost so many peers and

lord knows i've tried been a witness ta homicide
drive-bys taken lives little kids die
wonder why as i walk by
broken hearted as i glance at tha chaulk line gettin' high
this ain't tha life for me
i wanna change
but ain't no future right for me
i'm stuck in tha game
i'm trapped inside a maze
see this tangaray influenced me ta gettin' crazy
disillusioned lately
i've been really wanting babies
so i could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
don't trust my lady
'cause she's a product of this poison i'm hearen noises
think she's fucken on my boys can't take no more
i'm fallin' to tha floor
beggin' for tha lord ta let me in heavens door

verse three 2pac

cause life is hell and everybody dies
what about these people i despise -- them loud talkin' cowards
shootin guns into crowds jeapordizin lives
shoot 'em right between them thugz eyes it's time to realize
follow the rules or follow them fools that die
everybody's tryin' to make the news people confused
quit tryin' to be an og and pay your dues
if you choose to apply yourself go with the grain
and come the riches and the girls and the fame
heavy in the game
game's been good to me

when i was young me and my mama had beef
seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
though back at the time i never thought i'd see her face
ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
suspended from school scared to go home
i was a fool with the big boys breakin all the rules
shed tears with my baby sister
over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
and even though we had different daddies
the same drama when things went wrong we blamed mama
i reminisce on the stress i caused it was hell
huggin on my mama from a jail cell
and who'd think in elementary
hey i'd see the penitentiary
one day runnin from the police that's right
mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
and even as a crack fiend mama
you always was a black queen mama
i finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
you always was committed
a poor single mother on welfare
tell me how you did it? 
there's no way i can pay you back
but the plan is to show you that i understand

you are appreciated

lady don't ya know we love ya dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated
sweet lady don't ya know we love ya

now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
no love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there
he passed away and i didn't cry
'cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
they say i'm wrong and i'm heartless
but all along i was lookin for a father he was gone
i hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
they showed a young brother love
i moved out and started really hangin
i needed money of my own so i started slangin
i ain't guilty 'cause even though i sell rocks
it feels good puttin money in your mailbox
i love payin rent when the rent's due
i hope you got the diamond necklace that i sent to ya
'cause when i was low you was there for me
you never left me alone because you cared for me
and i can see you comin home after work late
you're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
you're just workin with the scraps you was given
and mama made miracles every thanksgivin
but now the road got rough you're alone
tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
and there's no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand

you are appreciated

lady don't ya know we love ya and dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated
sweet lady don't ya know we love ya

pour out some liquor and i reminisce
'cause through the drama i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that i'm hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are fulla all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act crazy
i gotta thank the lord that you made me
there are no words that can express how i feel
you never kept a secret always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
everything will be all right if you hold on
it's a struggle everyday gotta roll on
and there's no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand

you are appreciated

and i wish there was another way to stack a dollar
so my apoli' cause these hard times make me wanna holler

this high powered cell at the county jail

late night phone conversations -- would that be ok?

i can see you're cautious and i'm careful not to scare you
but anticipation of love makin'
got you shakin when i'm standin near you
news of precision will prepare ya
in case you get scared just ask the man in the mirror
now the picture's getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
i tell you to leave and you tell me keep my faith in god

my only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
wanna take you there but you scared to follow come see tomorrow
hoping i can take you through the pain and sorrow

the fact the only way a brother can survive the game
the block hard to get by the dope dealing fatal killings
in fair times so writing rhymes
it ain't just the police
we kill each other just lost another brother
fast living will get you took
thinking it can't happen to you and then it do 
off crooked schemes its just a drea
floating face down in the mainstream

think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
that's why some are found floating face down in the main stream

they swan divin'
fit they name be thrashing an album
go-kart rushin' to finish their album then you find them
lost dog paddling back stroking what done happened?
be rhymin' catching the day when the recipe calls for black and
wrong ingredients
maybe too much herbs and spices
maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish 
southern greens and this entice them how them joke the same
so i'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at
i'll even break my by back to touch their rim if i gotta
my alta mater be that i follow
i bite whatever that's looking tasty water it down then swallow
i hope you vomit won't call no names cause that's not my job
it just applies to whom it may concern you know who you are
but if you don't you never will you just receive the steel
but then it might get ugly cause trust me niggas do feel
the way that i felt when i wrote this but we must stay in focus
we kings and queens up in this thing get rid of all them jokers
face down face down face down

think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
that's why some are found floating face down in the main stream

i let you stay in my crib now you know where i live
when you was hungry fed you a hot meal look at the hand you deal
me crudball business giving niggas inches so here take a foot
luck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes
experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
i hope you don't mind me eating off of yours
process momma moping like jerry
meanwhile fairies of the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery
never to obtain another level of con-science
only to test to poke and see
why laying here they scheme over one another mouth to feed
??? with a decision to make now words shape your destiny
but a missle will take it all the way just as quick as you can say
i wish i never did what i did now face this biz
it was the company you kept the many places you slept
when you shouldn't have geekin like a rat jumping like a trap
contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showin pink for ten
they got you niggas where they want you again
floating face down in the mainstream
thats why thats why thats why

think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
that's why some are found floating face down in the main stream

everybody's a player rubbin them kangols on their head
thinking its all about your clothes nigger its all about your self
the way you feel about your life the times that you done shared with
your friends and family up and down like hoes give head
to dicks oh six serving them in the mix but ain't no mystery
you know the history about this clique bitch
oh what you don't want me to call you slut?
then why you fucking all them niggers letting them all up in your guts
but see that aids i'm afraid that's why i play the quiet role
i lay in the cut every month thinking i'll let that fire roll
like chimneys and smoke signals maybe peace pipes even
my partners call me big boi and my first name is not steven
in the mainstream home team banging them with these hits
in the mix flowing like some motherfucking swordfish

think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
that's why some are found floating face down in the main stream
think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
that's why some are found floating face down in the main stream
think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
that's why some are found floating face down in the main stream
think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
that's why some are found floating face down in the main stream",2

back and forth like a see-saw
jumpin' lily to lilypad dad

i never lived up to my expectations so i accept the patience
expect the worse but now i'm pacin'
back and forth inside i'm melting like water on wicked bitches
a monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
i had the best of life in my clinches but monkey wrenches was thrown
like chairs kings sit on my prayers seem to long
i fall asleep before the endin don't even get to say amen
i hope he understand i be on bended knees
at times i think i'm crazy so i say forget it
or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like riddick bowe
i've been fighting this since them fetus days
i count from one to twenty when i'm through repeat the phrase
it's just a phase it's gon all pass but that gets old too
i'm weakening like a deacon doin' dirt
what am i supposed to do?

trying to rob and steal

vocally arming you was my responsibility
it's killing me--thinking that all these niggas
see they fly shit--thinking they steven segall an
balling--falling to the wayside when ya try to call
i've fallen--when we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects
but now they carjacks wait on income tax and unsafe sex
they get the tecs to flex--like solo for tha lo-lo
smoke same thing no-no--not this time
niggas around my way can rhyme
so fuck that country shit--we done a bunch of shit

that even joe got problems that he gots to joust with
floating in this game of life
despite how out of place you may feel
in this race oh you just can't quit

i'm on the beat like cops
only cultivate the stable dirt when i skeet my drops
no concentrating knocking other niggas out the box
why?--cause in a sense
see we all be kind of fly
just can't be scared to spread your wings
head to better things
maybe the mockingbird and nightengale

1,"upon initial contact with ice-t's music i had envisioned him to be an ill-mannered and psychologically unstable man with an extremely uneducated and barbaric
frame of mind whose raps displayed nothing but ridiculous jargon shocking sexual audacity and repulsive images of the ghetto

however after further analysis of his music i can deduce that he is the epitome of
antidisestablishmentarianism who embodies the entire spectrum of the urban experience and struggle

but to make things more plain and simple to the layman i find ice-t to be the dopest flyist og pimp hustler gangster player hardcore motherfucker living today

to be honest i am totally and irrevocably on his dick",2

cold loungin' here in the new og lp you know original gangsters in the house

it's been a long while
since i hit ya with freestyle
high tech selection
from the vaults of the ice files
kick back relax
and watch as i melt wax
don't never let a brother like me
write a dope track
cause once i hit it with the vocal tone
it's mine have motherfuckers
rush'n to rewind
'cause i'll flow slow
and still twist your tongues up
rock the house from night
till the sun's up
cause it really ain't
how much you say
it's what you sy
i got no fuckin' time on the mic
to play
i write rhymes
with addition and algebra
mental geometry
don't even come at me
talk'n that weak and
popin' that bullshit
get out my face
a fool could get his head split
a lot of doubters
said it couldn't be done by me
them same suckers
are now lookin' from under me
wonder'n what i did
i didn't play myself kid
i respected my fans
and made the high bid
sometimes i write my rhymes
at night and fall asleep
wake up with new techniques
grab the pen
and place it on some loose leaf
nothin' soft always the tough meat
the white paper and
blue lines excite my mind
not allow'n me to stop the rhyme
until the whole motherfuckin'
book's complete
then i write on the
back of the sheets
i made promise
to my brothers in street crime
we'd get paid with the use
of a sweet rhyme
we put our minds together
made the tracks clever
now we're checkin'
more bank than ever

mind over matter
so ya got to have mind power like the fellah's say
mind over matter
mind power

i can drop rhymes in twos
and threes and fours
and still have much shit
left for encores
'cause when my mind locks
in on a dope idea
motherfuckin' ducks
should stand clear
'cause i'm a hit the topic point blank
it's jail ya better keep your shank
'cause i got mine
and i'm out on a solo creep
uggga your face hits the concrete
you wanna roll
with the niggas that don't play
i think you got false courge
get out my damn way
cause the car i'm in
is rollin' full of men
no kids or boys e got the mac 10
islam's got the zulu nation back up
dj aladdin's who
hooked the fuckin' track up
syndicate's make'n the move
with the ski masks
and i'm house'n the long cash
so now you realize
you underestimated the ice
you thought that i was ok
but now you realize i'm nice
but that's all right
'cause i knew i'd mke it in the end
those who like me now
might not of liked me then
but i'm a keep impressin'
stressin' my lesson
and keep motherfuckers guessin'
armor plate my mind
with walls and shields
as i escape from the killing fields

i can understand
mind over matter
i know what it means

makes you feel possessed to dance

sound crazy? well it isn't
the ends justifies the means that's the system
i learned that in school then i dropped out
hit the streets checked a grip and now i got clout
i had nothing and i wanted it
you had everything and you flaunted it
turned the needy into the greedy
with cocaine my success came speedy
got me twisted jammed into a paradox
every dollar i get another brother drops
maybe that's the plan and i don't understand
god damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand
but since i don't know and i ain't never learned
i gotta get paid i got money to earn
with my posse out on the ave
bump my sounds crack a forty and laugh
cool out and watch my new benz gleam
is this a nightmare? or the american dream?
so think twice if you're coming down my block
you wanna journey through hell? well shit gets hot
pregnant teens children's screams
life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam
you don't come here much and ya better not
wrong move bang ambulance cot
i gotta get more money than you got
so what if some muthafucka gets shot?
that's how the game is played

mitch
stone player
he meet a girl in five min he lay her
trucked crazy jewels
hands smothered in ice
been to prison not once but twice
kept a stupid thick posse
made of thugs and
crooks and hoods and vet hustlers
who were up to no good
but they all stood behind him and watched his back
that's the only way
to roll on the track

of his white
corniche
took a look inside
and what did they see?
two keys and a gallon of
pcp

three strikes that's called
habitual criminal
so insted of goin' under
he snitched on his whole posse
maxed at the crib
and sipped
martini and
rossi
sold out his whole crew
that rat named
mitch [chorus] i knew this guy
that was never that fly
couldn't act cool
even when he tried
when we played rough
he always cried
when he told stories he always lied
black brother
who was missin' the cool part
he had the color
but was missin' the true heart
when we would fight
he would always go down quick
so he took karate and he still got his ass kicked
but now he's married
and he kicks his wife's ass
says it comes from problems
that he had in the past
doesn't like
blacks
claims he's upper class
joined the police got himself a badge
now he rolls the streets and he's cut to jack
doggin' young brothers
'cause they usually don't fight back
got a
white partner
and he asked for that and every night
another head they crack
so now he's big man
but he really ain't shit [chorus]
out one night with my crew and some new kid i didn't know homeboy but
evil
e did
so i thought he was cool
we rode in his ride
rag top tray on
daytons
lifted side to side
we hit the party deep
niggas was hawkin' me
you could feel the vibe
of thick artillery
parliament was on some
og shit i put my back to the wall
and felt my pistol grip al of a sudden

8,"yo check this out
a lot of people get mad 'cause i use the word nigga

they say you a black man i tell 'em i'm a nigga they don't understand that
so i'm a say what i wanna say i call myself what i wanna call myself
you know what i'm saying
so they can stay off my dick

damn right i'm a nigga
and i don't care what you are
'cause i'm a capital n-i double-g-e-r
black people might get mad
'cause they don't see
that they're looked upon
as a nigga just like me
i'm a nigga not a coloured man
or a black or a negro
or afro american i'm all that
yes i was born in america true

that's why i'm not bitter
cause everybody is a nigga to a nigga
america was stole from he indians
show and prove what was that?
a straight up nigga move
a low down shame
yo it's straight insane
yet they complain
when a nigga snatch
their gold chains
what is nigga suppose to do?
wait around for a handout
from a nigga like you?
that's why a low down nigga gets hyped
but i'm not a nigga of that type
i'm a steak and lobster eatin
billionaire meetin

corporate jet glidin
limousine ridin'
writin' hits filthy rich
straight up nigga

now you keep me in constant sweat
but i'm a nigga that you'll never forget
a black bad iron clad always mad
fly nigga takin' off from a helipad
rolex divin buck wilin cap pilin

big dick straight up nigga",2
9,"ten years ago
i used to listen to rappers flow
talkin' 'bout the way
they rocked the mic at the disco
i liked how that shit was goin' down
with my own sound
so i tried to write rhymes
somethin' like them my boys said
that ain't you ice

that shit sounds like him
so i sat back thought up a new track
didn't fantasize kicked the pure
facts motherfuckers got scared
'cause they was unprepaired
who would tell it how it relly was?
who dared?
a motherfucker from the west coast
la south central fool
where the crips and the bloods play
when i wrote about parties
it didn't fit
six in the mornin'
that was the real shit

og original gangster

when i wrote about parties
someone always died
when i tried to write happy
yo i knew i lied i lived a life of crime
why play ya blind?
a simple look
and anyone with two cents
would know i'm
a hardcore player from the streets
rappin' bout hardcore topics
over hardcore drum beats
a little different
than the average though
jet you through the fast lane
drop ya on death row
cause anybody who's been there
knows that life ain't sho lovely
on the blood-soaked fast track
that invincible shit don't work
throw ya in a joint
you'll be comin' out feet first
so i blast the mic with my style
sometimes i'm ill
the other times buck wild
but the science is always there
i'd be a true sucker
if i acted like i didn't care
i rap for brothers just like myself
dazed by the game
in a quest for extreme wealth
but i kick it to you hard and real
one wrong move and your caps peeled
i ain't no super hero
i ain't no marvel comic
but when it comes to game i'm atomic
at droppin' it straight
point blank and untwisted
no imagination needed 'cause i lived it
this ain't no fuckin' joke
this shit is real to me
i'm ice-t

og

two weeks ago i was out at the disco
two brothers stepped up to me
and said
hey yo ice
we don't think you're down
what set ya claimin'?
e drew the glock yo my set's aimin'
dumb motherfucker
try to roll on me please
i'm protected by a thousand emcees
and hoodlums and hustlers
and bangers with jeri curls
we won't even count the girls
'cause they got my back
and i got theirs too
fight for the streets
when i'm on oprah or donahue
they try to sweat a nigga
but they just didn't figure
what my wit's as quick as a hair trigger
he's not your everyday-type
prankster

i'm ice-t the original gangster

so step to me
if you think that you're ready to
got on your bullet proof?
well mine's goin' right through
this ain't no game to me
it's hollow fame to me
without respect from streets
so i don't claim be
the hardest motherfucker on earth
catch me slippin i can even get worked
but i don't slip that often
there's a coffin
waitin' for the brother
who comes off soft when
the real fuckin' shit goes down
take a look around
all them pussies can be found
they talk a mean fight
but fight like hoes
i'm from south central fool
where everything goes
snatch you out your car so fast
you'll get whiplash
numbers on your roof top
for when the copters pass
gang bangers
don't carry no switch blades
every kid's got a tec 9 or a
hand grenade
thirty-seven killed
last week in a crack war

hostges tied up
and shot in a liquor store
nobody gives a fuck
the children have to go to school
well moms good luck
cause the shit's fucked up bad
i use my pad and pen
and my lyrics break out mad
i try to write about fun
andthe goodtimes
but the pen yanks away and explodes
and destroys the rhyme
maybe it's just cause of where i'm from
la that was a shot gun",2
10,"you know the houe down the street
where the kids are
and every day
they seem to have a new scar
something strange is going on
and everybody knows
doors always shut
windows always closed
the little girl had a burn
the boy was black and blue
they said it came from play
you know that shit ain't true
the boy's arm's broke
girl's scared to speak
their parents drink all day
couple of dead beats
some days they go to school
and other days they might
it's hard to stay awake
after you cry all night
you see 'em every day
tear tracks on their cheeks
but they will never tell
it goes on weeks and weeks
but what can they do?
they're only children man

you ain't no fuckin' kid
act like you give a damn
won't someone save these kids
do something call a cop

the other night i heard gun shots",2
12,"ice-t
everybody step back from the mic as i set it off
all playin' the wall it's time to sweat it off
anybody with static -- oh please try --
i'll do ya like godfather 3 and do a fly by
time to rip and hit and strangle
i eat guardian angels
and toy emcees with their names on the front page
i bury in shallow graves
i don't rap to girls on my lp
i don't beg for pussy
i love the ladies and they love me right back
now who's the mack?
mission accomplished
i came to stomp this
microphone and leave suckers unconscious
and if you you think you've got an s on your chest
you better wear two vests
watch your back your front
i always hit don't bunt
crazy posse when i'm out on a duck hunt
emcee ice he answers to no one
load my rhymes and cock 'em like a shotgun
let off like frags from a pipe bomb
a slow stroll and my mic in my right palm
the cops hate me and that's right they oughtta
before my crew gets to their daughters

nat the cat
do you know me? right
that's why i carry the mic
i'm not flashing my american express
i'm playing my cards close to my vest
my name that you say what i'm fessin'?
listen up and listen close and listen for the lesson

13,"midnight chillin' at am/pm
coolin' drinkin' apple juice
in evil's bm
the sound's up loud
to attract attention
armoraled tires
on a lowered suspension
nardi to steer with
alpine deck was glowin'
bumpinn' big daddy
and the nigga was definitely flowin'
i was ridin' shotgun
donald and hen in back
look through the tint recognized a jack
two brothers strolled up
talkin' bout get out
donald d blazed
shot one fool through his fuckin' mouth
why would they step
when they know we're strapped?
i never cruise la
without a gat in my lap
the other fool shot
caught the e in the shoulder blade
i busted through the car door
that's where the nigga laid
hen jumped out
dropped two nines in his forehead
evil was bleedin' bad
the car seats were turnin' red
looked to my left
there were two more carloads
niggas in hats and hoods
in an attack mode
and they hadn't yet begun to fight
e hit the gas
it was one past midnight

take me on a walk through hell
screams
south central
yo e drive drive man drive man fuck it just get the fuck outta here man

he didn't even answer that
checked the rear view
they were still out back
where were these brothers from?
what made these brothers come?
bang our back window
was removed by a shotgun
now hen g was shot
don caught a ricochet
these motherfuckers was ill
they didn't come to play
bust a right turn parked
and then we got left
hid in the the bushes
shot the gas tank to fake death
but would this really
keep them psyched?
three of us bleedin'
it was ten past midnight

midnight time for a homicide
screams
south central
c'mon man you all bleedin' bad man you got to keep up man we can't stop here

i really didn't like

ya see we was deep
in the hoover's hood
three niggas bleedin'
that shit don't look good
see over there red don't go
some places red's all they know
but not our luck
tonight we was real fucked
broke down an alley
and we instantly had to duck
fuckin' police on a gang sweep
no time to deal with one time
so we had to creep
broke through a back yard
ran through a vacant lot
e hen and don kept up
to be some niggas shot
shit was gettin' craazy
so i had to get busy
hen was bleedin' worse
and evil was gettin' dizzy
looked in a parking lot
i needed a snatch bar
had to hot wire
so i moved on an old car
it was a bucket but fuck it it had to do
started it up
and scooped my whole crew
two blocks later
we saw fuckin' blue lights
the pigs were behind us
it was half past midnight

take me on a walk through hell
south central
you all just lay down on the floor if this car man fuck the police man i'm-a handle this

when they pulled us over
shit got worse
i wait utill they got out
and then i hit reverse
fucked 'em up i seen one cop fall
threw it in gear yo i'm outty y'all
don't know how
but somehow we got away
lost the jackers the cops
dumped the gta
made it back to the hood
fixed the crew up
and even though evil's car blew up
we made it home and then i crashed out
thinkin' bout my all-night death bout
then somethin' woke me up
from my dark sleep
the sound of fuckin' police
when they're tryin' to creep
broke through my door
with no goddamn warning
looked at my watch
it was six in the mornin'",2
14,"off to the studio late night
time to cut another track
it's gotta be hype
got my rhyme book in hand
a blue loose leaf

on the line with a word quiz
i gotta show 'cause i'm livin' with the show

in the pourin' rain
i hate flyin'
but there's no time for slow trains
another show to do
i gotta caatch my crew
they left last night
in the bus around two
the plane's a small one
no fun at all
bouncin' round the air

get to the arena meet up with the crew
they tell me all the speakers blew
the cordless don't work
sound man's a jerk
somebody's gonna get hurt
i'm crazy mad
but my fans want autographs
i turn my angry frowns
into fake laughs
i can't be rude
'cause they wouldn't understand
i in't human no more i'm a superman

you can try

the lifestyles of the rich a and infamous

four hours till show time oh well
i might as well check in the hotel
get a little rest
before it's time to play
ten brothers standin' in the hallway
all with demo tapes
they need the hook up
they heard that i was
the one to look up
i can't ditch 'em
'cause they already saw me
i'll put my head down
maybe they'll ignore me
no chance ice what's goin' on?
i listened to twenty-five songs
and after thaat
the brothers still wouldn't leave
they started lookin' at my tv
i was gonna break down
if they didn't jet soon
snuck across the hall
and crashed in e's room
but then this freak came in
thought i was e
straddled her legs across me
ripped off her blouse
pushed her breast against my face
started girating her waist sounds fly
like a hype sex thriller?
but see she looked like godzilla
pushed her off me
home girl hit the floor
this is what it's like on tour
i hit the hallway it was crawlin' thick
could we take this picture real quick?
jumped into a pose
that i used a million times before
took pictures
with the whole damn floor
i couldn't say no not to my fans
you see they wouldn't understand

now it's show time time to flow time
evil lost the records
but we still gotta go time
the house is packed
everybody's on their feet
so i say throw on rakim's beat
e hits the fader and the crowd is lit
i start bustin' off some new shit
the stage is so smokey
that i almost fall off i start inhalin' it
i'm tryin' not to cough
i'm catchin' problems from every angle
the mic cords are tangled
i try to flow smooth
but my words are mangled
damn near slipped and broke my ankle
if that ain't enough
the police are hawkin'
listenin' real close
to the words i'm talkin'
they wanna put a brother like me
in the back seat
just because i curse the beat
they wanna tap my phone
wanna keep my crib bugged
call all my homes
felonist street thugs
you might say
i think this lifestyle sucks?
i wouldn't tade it for a million bucks
although it's all
not glamour and gleam
it's still my dream",2

you try to ban the ak
i got ten of 'em stashed
with a case of hand grenades

tell us what to do? fuck you
tell us what to do? fuck you

with defiance
because i have no alliance
with suckas who choose
not to act black
when they are black

not in a windowed room
but in a barred one

he needs a nobel prize

what are you doin' here?
our voice could be hard now
can we put him in the back?

robin robin robin
i used to get dressed for you'll now
i don't do that no more i'm sorry guys
it's a new day don't have the energy

you mind a joke
okay so these are brand new songs
and there are very few people who've heard
very much about you know what i've heard

i've been going through and what i've been learning lot of
lot of wonderful life lessons you know
they're not easy to come by but they're very blessed
after you realize why you had to go through
what you had to go through

it's just very important that you really listen to the words
you know and if you have a hard time hearin' what i'm sayin'
please just raise your hand and you know or something
object or you know whatever

you guys ready in there?
okay and you know it's real intersting
beacuse i used to i used to be performer
and i i really don't consider myself a performer so much any more
i really just you know i'm i'm sharing you know
more or less the music that i've been given

but if i stop if i start if i you know
feel like saying baby baby baby for eighteen bar's
whateverer you know i just i do that
but i'm all right so you guys are cool
i'll talk to people on my head too it's all right
let's just warm up a little bit
finish sucking my lozenge

this particular song is called mr attentional
let me see
we're all tuned up now",2
1,"it's funny how money change a situation
miscommunication leads to complication
my emancipation don't fit your equation
i was on the humble you on every station
some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb
but remember not a game new under the sun
everything you did has already been done
i know all the tricks from bricks to kingston
my thing done made your kingdom wan' run
now understand l boogie's non-violent
but if a thing test me run for me gun
can't take a threat to me newborn son
l's been this way since creation
a groupie call you fall from temptation
now you wanna ball over separation
tarnish my image in your conversation
who you gon' scrimmage like you the champion
you might win some but you just lost one

you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one

now now how come your talk turn cold
gained the whole world for the price of your soul
tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
now you're all floss what a sight to behold
wisdom is better than silver and gold
i was hopeless now i'm on hope road
every man wants to act like he's exempt
need to get down on his knees and repent
can't slick talk on the day of judgement
your movement's similar to a serpent
tried to play straight how your whole style bent?
consequence is no coincidence
hypocrites always want to play innocent
always want to take it to the full out extent
always want to make it seem like good intent
never want to face it when it's time for punishment
i know you don't wanna hear my opinion

and if you don't change then the rain soon come

you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one
you might win some but you just lost one

when it's all done did you really gain from
what you done done it's so silly how come
you just lost one

what you throw out comes back to you star
never underestimate those who you scar
cause karma karma karma comes back to you hard
you can't hold god's people back that long
the chain of shatan wasn't made that strong
trying to pretend like your word is your bond
but until you do right all you do will go wrong
now some might mistake this for just a simple song
and some don't know what they have till it's gone
now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
and from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
now some might listen and some might shun
and some may think that they've reached perfection
if you look closely you'll see what you've become
cause you might win some but you just lost one

you might win some but you just lost one

you might win some but you just lost one

torn and confused wasted and used
reached the crossroad which path would i choose
stuck and frustrated i waited debated
for something to happen that just wasn't fated

misled i bled till the poison was gone
and out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn

now i don't

was much more than being some foolish man's wife
showed me that love was respect and devotion
greater than planets deeper than oceans
my soul was weary but now it's replenished
content because that part of my life is finished

i see him sometimes and i look in his eyes
is one of a man who's lost treasures untold

and build mold and fold theyself into shape

whattup g? saw my face on tv
damn oh shit i didn't know i lucked out
struck out i gotta get the fuck out
pack my bags and tried to hit the door when
the ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
'cause the feds was out there ten deep
i got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
i think back when i was robbin my own kind
the police didn't pay it no mind
but when i start robbin the white folks
now i'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope
i said it before and i'll still taunt it
every motherfucker with a colour is most wanted",2
5,"once upon a time in the projects yo
i damn near had to wreck a ho
i knocked on the door - who is it? 
it's ice cube come to pay a little visit to ya
and what's up with the niggers in the parking lot
she said fuck em 'cause they get sparked alot
i sat on the couch but it wasn't stable
and then i put my nikes on the coffee table
her brother walked in he's into gangbangin
'cause he walked up and said what set you claimin
i don't bang i write the good rhymes
the whole scenery reminded me of good times
i hate to feel bad but i'm in a rut
by a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
and fired up the sess it was sess no doubt
she said please excuse my house and all that
i said yeah 'cause i was buzzed from the contact
lookin' at a fucked up black and white
her mom's bitchin cause the county check wasn't right
she had another brother that was three years old
and had a bad case of the runny nose
he asked me who i was then i had to pause
it smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
i saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked
only thirteen and already pregnant
i grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig
'cause i was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids
they were runnin' and playin' and cursin and yellin'
and tellin' and look at this young punk bailin
i heard a knock on the door without the password
and her mom's got the 12 gauge mossberg
the nigga said yo what's for sale
and the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo
she made the drop and got the 20 dollars
from a smoked out fool with ring around the collar
the girl i was waiting for came out
i said bitch i didn't know this was a crack house
i got my coat and suddenly 
police breaking into house annoucing themselves
the cop busted in and had a mac-10 pointed to my dome
and i said to myself once again it's on
he threw me on the carpet no slap jumped back
stomped on my head and put his knee in my back
first he tried to wrap me up slap me up rough me up
they couldn't do it so they cuffed me up
i said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take
hey yo officer you're making a big mistake
since i had on a shirt that said i was dope
he thought i was selling base and couldn't hear my case
he said get out my face i musta had a grudge
his reply tell that bullshit to the judge
the girl i was with wasn't sayin' nothin'
i said aiyyo bitch you better tell 'em somethin'
she started draggin and all of a sudden
we all got tossed in the patty wagon
now i beat the rap but that ain't the point
i had a warrant so i spent 2 weeks in the joint
now the story you heard has one little object
don't fuck with a bitch from the projects",2
6,"turn on the radio take a listen
what you're missing
personally i'm sick of the ass-kissing
what i'm kicking to you won't get rotation
nowhere in the nation
program directors and djs ignored me
'cause i simply said fuck top forty
and top thirty top twenty and top ten
until you put more hip-hop in
then i might grin but don't pretend that you're down with the c
and go and dis me in a magazine
how could you figure the brother could dig ya
dj face down in the river
no it's not a threat but a promise
i'm as
crazy as they come see
mama didn't love me
all i got is my nine
and to calm the savage beast here's the alpine

turn off that bullshit
turn off that motherfucking radio
turn off that bullshit
turn off that motherfucking radio
turn off that bullshit
play the music motherfucker put the music on
damn

tune in to the radio listen for a minute
yo g stick a fucking tape in it
cause all the radio do is gangle
that r&ampb love triangle
if you're out there kicking it with the brothers
you don't care about lovers
you wanna hear a young nigga on the mic
going buck wild
throwing and flowing and showing new styles
that's where i'm coming from
reality that's what they're running from
so if you're down with ice cube let me know that you know
yo turn off the radio

you know what? you know what?
basically those black guys and those rap guys
they don't know what the fuck they're doing
i hate those fuckers
i hate em
especially that one guy
the amerikkka's most wanted
ice cube--i hate that fucker
get him off the air get him off get him off
get that rap shit out of here
just get me a gat so i can smoke this motherfucker",2
7,"verse one ice cube

peace - don't make me laugh
all i hear is motherfuckers rappin' sucotash
livin' large tellin' me to get out the gang
i'm a nigga gotta live by the trigger
how the fuck do you figure?
that i can say peace and the gunshots will cease?
every cop killer goes ignored
they just send another nigga to the morgue
a point scored- they could give a fuck about us
they rather catch us with guns and white powder
if i was old they'd probably be a friend of me
since i'm young they consider me the enemy
they kill ten of me to get the job correct
to serve protect and break a niggas neck
'cause i'm the one with the trunk of funk
and 'fuck tha police' in the tape deck
you should listen to me 'cause there's more to see
call my neighborhood a ghetto 'cause it houses minorities
the other color don't know you can run but not hide
these are tales from the darkside

verse two

you wanna free africa i stare at yuh
'cause we ain't got it too good in america
i can't fuck with them overseas
my homeboy died over a key of cocaine
it was plain and simple
the 9mm went &ltpop&gt to the temple
&ltpop pop pop&gt was the sound i put the bitch down
and ran to the schoolyard bathroom
looked in the trash can yo it had room
so i ducked my ass in it for a minute
covered with trash i had to lay back
mad as fuck thinkin' about the payback
tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
i went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
it's gettin' critical - i stole a 50
i let it go - drive real slow
i yelled out 'ice cube sucka'
the shot-gun kicked - and it murdered motherfuckers
i told you last album
when i got a sawed off bodies are hauled off
it's a shame that niggas die young
but to the light side it don't matter none
it'll be a drive by homicide
but to me its just another tale from the darkside

verse three chuck d

standing in the middle of war
in the middle we flex
when we die we won't make +jet+
+ebony+ can't see to the lightside
the term they apply to us is a nigga
call it what you want 'cause i'm comin' from the coroner
sayin' my rhymes with a phd
who's black - don't wanna role - sells his soul
watch his head go rollin'
who the fuck are they foolin?
nobody knows but i suppose the color of my clothes
matches the color of the one on my face
as they wonder what's under my waist
[standin on the verge] of them gettin' brown
that's a fact got a fear on their bozack
run run run their ass off they can not hide
yet cube they can't fuck with the darkside",2

verse one ice cube

little boys and girls they all love me
come sit on the lap of i-c-e
and let me tell ya a story or two
about a punk-ass nigga i knew
named jack he wasn't that nimble wasn't that quick
jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick
ran up the street 'cause he was piping hot
met a bitch named jill on the bus stop
dropped a line or two and he had the hoe
at that type of shit he's a pro
so jack and jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap
dumb bitch gave him the claps
then he had to go see dr bombay
got a shot in the ass and he was on his way
to make some money why not?
down on sesame street the dope spot
there he saw the lady who lived in a shoe
sold dope out the front but in back marijuana grew
for the man that was really important
who lived down the street in a air jordan
ride to the fellow mister rogers and hoes
drove a 500 sittin' on lorenzoes
he broke out little bo peep smoked out
saw her and her friends sellin sheepskins

[little bo peep] yo yo i got them sheepskins
yo my empty sheepskins
yo baby what's up with that?

hickory dickory dock it was twelve o'clock
cinderella ain't home must be givin' up the cock
i don't doubt it she is kind of freaky of course
had a fight with snow white she was fuckin' her dwarfs
saw a fight over colors too
red riding hood and little boy blue
a bad influence? yo i don't know
but ice cube'll tell the kids how the story should go

verse two ice cube

humpty dumpty sat on a wall
with a joint drinkin' some 8-ball
three little pigs in a coup de ville
lookin' for the wolf to kill
they're fucked up and they want revenge
them and humpty used to be friends
now they're enemies 'cause he's a traitor
pulled out the uzi cruised by and sprayed him
cinderella hoeing for the fellas
and mister rogers is gettin' mighty jealous
of the cash that the pigs were makin'
time for the pigs to get turned to bacon
cause mister rogers found out quick
that humpty dumpty was blown to bits
they said that the motherfuckin wolf was next
so mister rogers better watch his step
so he let the wolf know
we're gonna fuck up the pigs and take their ho
cause cinderella is much too fast
before twelve givin' up ass
double barrels all loaded and cocked
as soon as they show they gonna get popped
they bailed down sesame street and caught em
little boy blue is up front givin' orders
little did they know cinderella was a fink
she called the cops and got thrown in the clink
a bad influence? yo i don't know
but ice cube'll tell the kids how the stories should go

they think i'm a star so i take advantage
it's just another ice cube groupie test
she's a hoe 'cause they knew her at the front desk
told her to meet me at the room 110
and the bitch showed up with her boyfriend
i let him in all he could do was grin
he had a camera a t-shirt a pad and pen
he said yo ice cube can you sign this? 
i only did it cause his bitch was the finest
she blew me a kiss and gave a bitter frown
like - how can we get rid of this clown?
me and her sat down he got a little jealous
cause his punk ass sat in the middle of us
and he asked me question after question
it felt like a motherfuckin interview session
then his girl got up i heard the do' shut
and he was still there swingin' from my nuts
i said get the fuck out and made it loud and clear

first i load the clip and then i make the hit
i know some y'all can't fade this
lench mob niggas are the craziest
so you and your boys are ass-out
when i'm rollin' in a seven-deuce glass house
the mob ain't nothing but a menace
when we get the motherfucking dog in us
playing them old beats
i'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies
ready to peel your cap
you can't believe faces of death on wax
some say the mob ain't positive
man fuck that shit 'cause i gots to live
how i live and you could either give a fuck punk
yo or get your ass bucked
some rappers are heaven-sent
but self-destruction don't pay the fucking rent
so you can either sell dope or get your ass a job
i'd rather roll it wit the lench mob

to be down with the mob is simple
mind your own you want a spot find your own
and take mine if you're badder than the strong man
i do the right thing i do the wrong thing
do anything 'cause i ain't faking the scene
it's all about how much bacon you bring
and if you see something from the gat i will stuff it
yo you ain't seen nothing
'cause if you testify you're living blind
cause in the city you live and let die
rolling with the fools one time can't beat
on my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet
he said i know you i said you might
my name is ice cube i did a song you didn't like
so he soaked me up like bounty
had to do a week in the county
a piece of cake it was just like a party
cause in the county you know everybody
no i didn't kill or steal or rob
locked up for what 'cause i'm rollin' wit the lench mob

if you know a female that's rollin' with the lench mob
watch your step cause the gat is kept
in the purse like my homegirl yo-yo
you gotta be down and you can't be a hoe no
'cause if you are i'll be the first one to bust you out
after my crew i'll be the first one to rush you out
get the picture or bitch
you'll get the eighty-six
if she wanna try and mix
business and pleasure make up your own mind
you gotta be a hoe on your own time
don't sleep cause even on a solo creep
yo the mob is still deep
and we'll play ya just like a nit-wit
you thought you got with the crew you can't get with
so get the noose ready for the lynching
now 235 is what i'm benching
but nowadays it's still not enough
i got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush

stay down and play the playground you little girl

what you're saying i don't consider it as rapping
'cause you're on rewind and i'm the new what's-happening
it never fails i'll always get respect
and you lose so take a rain check

hell no cause you know that i'm first and you're second
if it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant

shaking and faking while i'm bringing home the bacon

too much knowledge kicked then you're lost
in a shuffle of feet jinx the fiddler
and i control your mind like hitler
you bow and vow to authority
see now a sucker with a style just boring me
so i show know
ledge it might trouble you
then i transform like a decepticon
with a mic as a bomb
in my right palm
but i don't stay calm
so panic
others can't flow so they go schizophrenic
you thought i dropped a dud in your face
until you taste the blood of the bass
then you faint or better yet pass out
when i'm on the mic believe it's ass out
you think you're raw so you draw
you lose you're hung you bite your tongue
the whole town saw in awe as you strangle
a noose on your neck and you dangle
from side to side in the blazing heat
you're beat you're dead the fools fell off
you feel you're turning red it's said
that your head burst
and this is only the first verse
of the bomb

break

don't break up the fight let them rumble
over the years i've watched some go super-bad quick
now the smell of the pen has got them sick to the stomach
now ask yourself who's stupid?
i take funky funky beats and i loop it
and pimp slap you in the face with the bass
and the boom from the bomb that i drop
stop
you have a flat top as a fashion
i love black women with a passion
but when they gotta go and show their ass in
i gotta clown the hoes yeah
you gotta watch the ones with the big derrieres
they'll steer you wrong
ice cube's got it going on hit me
for the gangster boogie two times for the gangster rhyme
the system ain't wholesome
they want to put a young brother in folsom
and others see me on lockdown
but i come up foul then they get knocked out word
to the brother that rolls the herb
everybody getting knocked to the curb like that
jinx got the gat and it's a fact
he'll kick a funky beat to peel your cap
now who's the mack?
who's the hoe?
who's the trick?
i got many many styles won't you take a pick
but don't be alarmed
when i trip and stumble and fumble
and drop the rewind
drop the bomb

i'm solo you ask how i'm living
still dropping more shit than a pigeon
with the l the e the n the c the h
the m the o the b the great
lyrics that make the beat swing and i gotcha
it's the hip-hopper that don't like coppers
and if you try to upset the pot son
you get kicked in the chest like a shotgun
i make the beats i make the breaks
i make the rhymes that make you shake
make you find
ice cube never caught in the middle
i make shit to kick you in the ass a little
and still never hesitate to stutter step
or bust a repitition on the mic
still dissing all the hype
from left to right
how many left to fight?
so what that lench mob like?",2
0,"intro one not included on 7

when i was little my father was famous
he was the greatest sam-urai in the empire
and he was the shogun's decapitator
he cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords
it was a bad time for the empire
the shogun just stayed inside his castle -- and he never came out
people said his brain was infected by devils
my father would come home -- he would forget about the killings
he wasn't scared of the shogun but the shogun was scared of him
maybe that was the problem
then one night the shogun sent his ninja spies to our house
they were supposed to kill my father but they didn't
woman screams
that was the night everything changed voice fades

intro two rza

see sometimes
you gotta flash 'em back
see niggaz don't know where this shit started

verse one

fake niggaz get flipped
in mic fights i swing swords and cut clown
shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
i flow like the blood on a murder scene like a syringe
on some wild out shit to insert a fiend
but it was yo out the shop stolen art
catch a swollen heart from not rollin' smart
i put mad pressure on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
that's minimum and feminine like sandals
my minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
energy is felt once the cards are dealt
with the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
that attack the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
i represent from midnight to high noon
i don't waste ink nigga i think
i drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
clouds of smoke of natural blends of weed
only under one circumstance is if i'm blunted
turn that shit up my clan in da front want it

verse two

i'm on a mission that niggaz say is impossible
but when i swing my swords they all choppable
i be the body dropper the heartbeat stopper
child educator plus head amputator
cause niggaz styles are old like mark 5 sneakers
lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
don't even stop in my station and attack
while your plan failed hit the rail like amtrak
what the fuck for? down by low i make law
i be justice i sentence that ass two to four
round the clock that state pen time check it
with the pens i be stickin but you can't stick to crime
came through with the wu slid off on the dl
i'm low-key like seashells i rock these bells
when the mc's now come aboard it's medina bound
enter the chamber and it's a whole different sound
it's a wide entrance small exit like a funnel
so deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
niggaz are fascinated how the shit begin
get vaccinated my logo is branded in your skin",2

verse one the genius

yo
picture bloodbaths and elevator shafts
like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
check the print it's where veterans spark the letterings
slow moving mc's is waitin for the editin
the liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
a gaseous element that burned down your ministry
herbal vapors and biblical papers
smokin' exodus every square yard is plush
fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
leaves impressions try to keep a shark nigga guessin
give crazy shouts son here's the outcome
cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
shit is outdated just like neckloads of sterlings
suede-fronts bell-bottoms and tri-colored shearlings
i ain't particular i bang like vehicular homicides
on july 4th in bed-stuy
where money don't grown on trees and there's thievin mc's
who cut-throat to rake leaves
they can't breathe blood splash rushin fast

duel of the iron mic

verse two master killer

this is not a eighty-five affair made clear
when the gods get on to perform storms blew up
wu's up causin the crowd to self-destruct
killer bees are stingin somethin' while i reveal
science that's heavily guarded by the culprit
bombin your barracks with aerodynamic
swordplay poison darts by the doorway
minds that's laced with explosive doses
damagin lyrical launcher
lunge at the youthful offender then injure
any contender testin the murderous master
could lead to disaster dynamite thoughts
explode through your barrier rips the retina
who can withstand the astonishing punishing
stings to the sternum shocked in the hip-hop livestock
seekin' for a serum to cure em

verse three inspector deck

adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
duckin handcuffs throats get cut when dough rush
out of town foes look shook but still pose
we move lioke real pros through the streets we stroll
bullet holes lace the windows in one-six oh
so control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
bulding lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
bitches caught in airports keys in they vaginas
no peace yo the police mad corrupt
you get bagged up dependin if you're passin the cut
plus shorty's not a shorty no more he's livin' heartless
regardless of the charges claims to be the hardest
individual critical thoughts criminal minded
blinded by illusion findin it confusin

outro ol dirty bastard

duel of the iron mics [the master he must be dreaming heh]
it's that fifty-two fatal strikes [well if he is dreaming]
duel of the iron mics [then he must be asleep]
it's that fifty-two fatal strikes nuh [and if he is asleep]
then i will wake him up
weahhhhaah-hah-hah

each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
in the passion and depth of their struggle
they very art that had raised them through such rapiant heights was lost

my rhyme gross weight vehicle combination
was too heavy for the chevy's is chased out the station
double-edged was the guillotine that beheaded it
gassed up fuckin' with some regular unleaded shit
heads roll on hillsides behind ropes that
bind-in x marks the spot on the scope
heavily armed military is necessary it's a gamble
mc's bet they best at every

if tampered with set off and strike like pipe bombs

my preliminary attack keep cemeteries packed
of niggaz who think it ain't like that
mc's are gunned down like being run down with mad trucks
them god struck religious niggaz call it bad luck
rap celeb you got caught up in the web
now bees are stingin yo that niggaz em-singin'
i'm just swingin' swords strictly based on keyboards
unbalanced like elephants and ants on see-saws
i throw raps that attack like the japs on pearl harbor
mc's be out like bank robbers
fleeing the scene to be a sole survivor
dj the getaway driver
tried to dip but he dive i socialize on vocal vibes
on tracks stabbed up with razor sharp knives
criminal subliminal minded rappers find it
hard to define it when narrow is the gate
for fat tapes and then played out and out of date
then i construct my thoughts on site to renovate
and from that point the god made a statement
draftin tracements replacements in basements
materials in sheet-rock to sound proof the beat box
and microscopic optics received through the boxes
obnoxious topic major labels flavor tropical
punchlines that's unstoppable
ring like shots from glocks that attract cops
around the clubs and try to shut down the hip-hop

i'm deep down in the back streets - in the heart of medina
about to set off something more deep than a misdemeanor
under the subway waiting for the train to make noise
so i can blast a nigga and his boys - for what?
he pushed up on the block and made the dope sales drop
like the crashin of dow jones stock
i had to connect to cross seals to catch more mil's
than ho-bitches got birth control pills
i'm in the park settin up a deal over blunt fire
bum niggaz sleepin' on the bench they had 'em wired
peeped my convo the address of my condo
and how i changed a nigga name to john doe
and while we set up camp we got vamp
put the stake through his heart i ripped his fucking fangs apart
snake got smoked on the set like brandon lee
blown out the frame like pan am flight 103
he got swung on his lungs was torn the
kingpin just castled with his rook and lost a pawn
a regular on the block and played look-out
for playing predator with a glock he should have took out

it's mandatory that
i supply all my troops with mega firearms
big apes and spread 'em out like crops on a farm
to get cream sometimes they repaint the scene
like the last episode on gates and other niggaz
plant bombs till the smoke from the blast becomes thick
and flows through all they knew he's gun sick
his glock clicks like high-heeled shoes on parquay floors
mad sick stand on hills and invade wars
filthy foul shoveling dirt he's out to hurt
for instance chop off hands attack worth
his idols would lock down airports and extort
some import catchin ten percent of what the fiends snort
up in the ski resorts up in hills
they move keys and had skis making drops on snowmobiles
the plan was to expand catch seven figures release triggers
and live large and bigger than my nigga
who promised his moms a mansion with mad rooms
she died and he still put a hundred grand in her tomb
open wounds he hid behind closed doors
and still organized his crime and drug wars

it was the night before new year's and all through the fucking projects
not a handgun was silent not even a tec

and blasted on the spot before the pigs were there

they escape before them flash the fucking lights
gunshots shatter first floor window panes
shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
whether broke callisthenic any style you set it
beat niggaz toothless physically cut up like gooses
but with iron on the sides thugs took no excuses
therefore your fifty-two handblocks was useless
links was snatched off necks scars on throats
jackets took after bullet rips through coats
against those who felt the cold from the steel made 'em fold
and squeal once the metal hit the temple of his grill
destruction worker who was caught for his bomber
no time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his farmer's
and it's bugged how some niggaz catch slugs
and pockets dug from everything except check stubs
and it does sound ill like wars in brownsville
or fatal robberies in red hook where feds look
for fugitives to shoot cops niggaz laying on roof tops
for his cream he stashed in a shoebox
but he was hot and the strip was filled with young killers
you don't suspect so cops creep like caterpillars
and born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets

i'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
my eye's the vision memory is the film
others act sub-tile but they fragile above clouds

stop the stuttering boy save the planes for the five-oh
then praise the god - chk-a-chk pow
they be lick shots and premeditate to grab
and then they jet back to the lab
and then remain in shaolin
an endangered island
shorties lose blood by the gallon

have integrate a number of corrupt cops judges
into high-level positions to insure the continued
success of the drug smuggling and money laundering operations

verse three ghost face killer

yo i grab the pen for revenge and let loose see
like muslims standing on the block rocking a khufi
the hundred-dollar kick rockin' kid's back for more
startin gold wars with black reeboks and velours
jungle royal life livin' villain
packed with visions copywritten
throwin' bread to pigeons christ has risen king elegant
slang-master jackets expensive noodle hats
in sixty-nine old times was time that brothers shot craps
the baggy blue guess jeans pull strings off of callin springs
i'm locked in the thing rocky ring labelled rap king
the corner emperor - the golden thieves play the benches
rednecks be hanging big niggaz down in memphis
back in now-y hit the bull's eye with loaded nines
life is like tarzan swingin' from a thin vine
shatter dreams then mirrors don't need a press spirals
aim at the white shadows with big barrels
of moet-ahs the bald headers milk and amarett-ahs
who fear none question all personal vendettas yo
they use guns while we angrily shot arrows
you better keep your eye on the sparrow

verse one

yo
i'm not caught up in politics
i'm no black activist on a so-called scholar's dick
i come through with the wu and drop math
and versatile freestyles bombs and phonographs
and deliver all things and other in weight
searched to death on how living things relate
cause at a young age i was molded in a religion i relied on
and got caught up in superstition
scared to split pole duck black cats
once in a while threw salt over my back
but with knowledge of self from off the shelf
made things seemed complicated now small like elves
so turn off the lights light a candle and have a seance
pull the lid off the dean martin scandal
witches warlocks spooks and holy ghosts
rza lets defraud the host

verse two

we were on the same ship when the slaves were checked
i had to pull your card you was on the top deck
so i plotted my escape i saw the thin line between love and hate
and fast from the hog on the plate
i suffered brutal pains from whips and chains
punishments that were set to wash the brain
so look listen observe and also respect this jewel
drawed up di-tect and reflect this
light i shine that cause my power to be find
through the truth which manifest through eternal minds
purified gases and masses the same elements
that helped spark civilization classes
i see brothers quote math plus degrees
look at professor ass niggaz can't feed they own seeds",2

lyrics

i was always taught my do's and don'ts
for do's i did and for don'ts i said i won't
i'm from brooklyn a place where stars are born
streets are shot up apartment buildings are torn
and ripped up stripped up shacked up and backed up
from fiends cause the bosses on the scene they got it cracked up
kids are slingin in my lobby
little steve and bobby
gettin' paid but it's a life-threatening hobby
yeah they still play hide and seek
the fiends seek for the crack and they hide and let the cops peep
grown folks say they should be out on their own
before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
because they lifestyle is hectic so fuckin' hectic
blaow blaow blaow bullets are ejected
my lifestyle was so far from well
coulda wrote a book with a title age 12 and goin' through hell
then i realized the plan
i'm trapped in a deadly video game with just one man
so i don't only watch my back i watch my front
'cause it's the niggaz who front they be pullin stunts
back on the ave of lavonia and bristol with a pistol
stickin up pamela and crystal
you know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest
kid come home from doin' the bid and nothin' changes
what is the meaning of crime what?
is it criminals robbin innocent motherfuckers everytime?
little shorties take walks to the schoolyard
tryin' to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard
then as soon as they reached the playground blaow
shots ring off and now one of them lay down
it's so hard to escape the gunfire
i wish i could rule it out like an umpire
but it's an everlasting game and it never cease to exist
only the players change so

rza - i gotcha back 8x
i gotcha back so you best to watch your front
'cause it's the niggaz who front that be pullin stunts
i gotcha back but you best to watch your front
it's the niggaz who front that be pullin stunts

outro lp version only

old man
your tech nique is mag-ni-ficent
when cut across the neck
a sound like wailing winter winds is heard they say
i'd always hoped to cut someone like that someday
to hear that sound
but to have it happen to my own neck is ridiculous
man gasps for air",2
12,"the basic instructions before leaving earth 3x

chorus repeat 2x

life is a test many quest the universe
and through my research i felt the joy and the hurt
the first shall be last and the last shall be first
the basic instructions before leaving earth

verse one
knowledge this wisdom this goes back when i was twelve
i loved doing right but i was trapped in hell
had mad ideas sad eyes and tears
years of fears but yo my foes couldn't bear
i searched for the truth since my youth
and went to church since birth but it wasn't worth the loot
that i was payin' plus the prayin'
i didn't like staying 'cause of busybodies and dizzy hotties
that the preacher had souped up with lies
had me cooped up lookin' at loot butt and thighs
durin' the service he swallowed up the poor
and after they heard this they wallowed on the floor
but i ignored and explored my history that was untold
and watched mysteries unfold
and dropped a jewel like solomon but never followed men
'cause if you do your brain is more hollow than
space oblivion or the abyss
with no trace of trivia left with the hiss
does it pay to be deaf dumb and blind?
from a slave we was kept from the mind
and from the caves he crept from behind
and what he gave was the sect of the swine
when the bible it condemned the pig
i don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs
but we used to wear a turban but now we're in the urban
no more wearing beanies and dress like a genie
no hocus-pocus 'cause i focus on the facts
and put it on the tracks and brought it through the wax
i speak on jacob it might take up some time
and too much knowledge it might break up the ryhme
i did it anyway just to wake up the mind
of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet
those who sit home or sell books by the market
need to chill and get their mind revived
for years religion did nothing but divide
the basic instructions before leaving earth

verse two
i strolled through the books of job to unfold
and open bibles instead of hoping on revivals
calling on his name and screaming hallelujah
when he hardly knew ya-that's how the devil's fooled ya
see look into my eyes brethren-that's the lies of a reverend
why should you die to go to heaven?
the earth is already in space the bible i embrace
a difficult task i had to take
i studied till my eyes was swollen and only arose when
i found out that we were the chosen
i deal with the truth and build with the youth
and teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
son life is a pool of sin corrupted wth foolish men
and women with wicked minds who build picket signs
to legalize abortion the evil eye distortion
i quiz son with my wisdom
before i converted i was perverted and knowledge was asserted
the study of wisdom i perferred it
the understanding it gave me mental freedom
i even learned caucasians were really the tribe of edam
the white image of christ is really cesare borgia
and uh the second son of pope alexander vi of rome
and once the picture was shown
that's how the devils tricked my dome
i prophesied to save a man but no one gave a damn
for my nation-the seed of abraham
blessed with the tongue of hebrew
now we're strung on needles and some are plungin' evils
so study and be wise in these days of darkness
peace to my nephew marcus

and just imagine if each one is teachin' one
we'll come together so that we become
a strong force then we can stay on course
find your direction through introspection
and for my people out there i got a question
can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
now who's gonna take the weight?

the weight of the world is heavy on my mind
so as my feelings unwind i find
that some try to be down just 'cause it's trendy
others fall victim to envy
but i'll take the road less travelled
so i can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
relievin' your stress expressin' my interest
in the situation that you're facin'

i said i know the stuff we had planned but please understand
right now i'm loungin' with my man

just neglect her like that

some girls that i knew stepped up and asked me to come to
a party they were havin' at their house
i looked at my girl and yo she started walkin' out
i said hey love just wait for a second
and won't you just check it? it's all a part of makin' records
those were just some friends in the business
no need to get angry so listen up while i kick this

about havin' trust? what's all this attitude stuff?

want to do a dance or two

he could pop you and jet without a getaway car
and some might say that he's a dummy
but he's sticking you and taking all your money
it's a daily operation
he might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
mad brothers know his name
so he thinks he got a little fame
from the stick-up game

he's at a party with his man
they got their eye on the gold chain
that the next man's wearing
it looks big but they ain't staring

give up the rolex watch or you won't see another day”
see they were on the attack
and one said “yo you want to make this to a homicide rap?
make it fast so we can be on our way
kick in the rings and everything okay?”
the kid was nervous and flinching
and little shorty with the 3-8 yo he was inching
closer and closer put the gun to his head
shorty was down to catch a body instead
money was scared so he panicked
took off his link and his rings and ran frantic
but shorty said “naw” pulled the trigger and stepped
it was nothing he did it just to get a rep

rolling with troops of the sons like a gangster figure
hes near the peak of his crazy career
his posse's a nightmare macking jewls and some crazy gear
but as we know these things do come back
and shortys now peeping others that are scheming the kind of act

the guru will tell em why their records ain't sellin
placin' my fingers on the tool i runaway all fools
when i'm dispersin a verse
think of an enjoyable moment then boogie your body
cause this party i own it
the origin of this is on paper
vibes will ascend from my mind to each line
i go with the flow as i show expertise
the powers increase as my voice hits the streets
then gripping your soul with authority
i pour these rhymes in a cup so drink up
and then i might bring another round
watch the sound pound from the floor to the ground
and keep aware 'cause we'll show you the best way
and then sway as i read my s-a",2

my subject matter and context are blessed
vocal inflection connects it's a slugfest
ladies approach to hear quotes from the spokesman
thoughts are like oceans for my lyrics to float in
i'm absolutely astute so salute
you try to be cute and you get tossed like a crap shoot
don't misinterpret or slander
just get with the words and the way i command ya
'cause you're in the right place and luckily it's the right time
and since i'm inclined i'll kick precisely the right rhymes

premier cuts and scratches to kick the right rhyme

guru
listen listen listen i'll tell ya
my rhymes are like shelter or rather like an umbrella
protecting you from the weak stuff you heard from those creampuffs
about the schemes that they dreamed of
about the way they slayed this one or that one
but won't step to me 'cause they know the last one
who tried to match the panache of the guru
received a curse that was much worse than voodoo
cause the effect of my voice is immense
it would make more sense if suckers hide in the basement
but yo i don't look for hassles my rhymes are like castles
i got much flavor and class too
i know you've notice i'm a writer of hype lines
because i'm inclined to kick precisely the right rhymes

premier cuts and scratches to kick the right rhyme

guru
precisely the right rhymes simplistic but packed
with power and punch and yo you might want to step back
but stay close as your host serves hors d'oeveurs
satisfying your cravings and calming your nerves
see i have an interest in giving you more than the next man
cause my style is pure and
if you are sane and remain in your right mind
you'll see i'm inclined to kick precisely the right rhymes

17,"the meaning of the name gangstarr well i'll tell ya
it means i find my mind can excel to
a greater type of thought brought by the things that i've been taught
in relation to things that i rebel to divine and combine
with a sense of confidence
accomplishments are achieved off lots of gifts
but slopiness i could never tolerate it
not the guru nor premier you don't know how long we've waited
while other groups have faded just like haircuts
we use sheer guts to open the earducts of your brain
to expose every vain
cause you sound plain insane and mundane it's a shame
you've got no beats so you get no seats
at this table you ain't stable with the mic cable
kane and able jealous brothers
and i knew some girls who were overzealous lovers
but back to the act of developing the gangstarr track
it means that nothing can be wack
the music is picked right the mic is gripped tight
the lyrics i kick right to a beat like kryptonite power
not withstood by any mortal or immortal
to make you get on the floor till
another dope jam we slam with precision
bringing beams of light like the colors in a prism
or reflections through a spectrum
and all the soft silly suckers i'ma wet them
in other words destroy boy and then claim my fame
this is the meaning of the name

dj premier cuts what does it all mean?

guru
gangstarr it means a lot to me
it means i'm free to bust rhymes sporadically
gang represents my boys or a posse
so just back up off me
and the starr symbolizes the power
making the suckers and weak brothers cower
we got strong intelligent minds with a street sense
crazy offense and stupid defense
now have i made myself clear?
or do i have to call on dj premier?
for he and i make up the songs that you long for
meanwhile ducks just knock on the wrong door
waiting for a call or for the doors to open
'cause they're hoping that they'll get chosen
but to be chosen is a divine gift
you better get a job quick
see you can't rhyme and all your beats are weak
you oughta take a peak and check out the technique
seek and you shall find
gangstarr stands for mastermind
simple and plain and yo this ain't no game lame
this is the meaning of the name

once upon a time not long ago
when people wore adidas and lived life slow
when laws were stern and justice stood
and people was behavin' like hip-hop was good
there lived a little boy who was misled
by a little sha-tan and this is what he said
me and you kid we gonna make some cash
jackin' old beats and makin' the dash
they jacked the beats money came wit' ease
but son he couldn't stop it's like he had a disease
he jacked another and another michael jackson stevie wonder
set some r &amp b over the track for 'deep cover' 187
the kid got wild startin' actin' erratic
he said yo that presidential i got ta have it
with liquor in his belly son he made up the track
but little did he know that his joints was wack
the shiny a &amp r said great new hit g
whenever you need a loop yo come get me
the kid got amped and he starts to figure
i'm-a get dough like all-a these otha niggaz
so he's in the studio workin' 'round the clock
for pop radio jacked the beat to 'planet rock'
was out in the street when he met this sister
who couldn't sing for shhhh but the mix wit' her sister
hooked up the track and in excitation
he decided he'd head for the radio station
but but he was runnin' and he made a left
was skeezin' at top speed and ran into mos def
i slowed the young man down and i started yo money
yo why you sellin' lies to our wives and children?
he ran upstairs up to the top floor
opened up the door then guess what he saw? who?
jane the chickenhead radio host
who be yappin' 'bout beef between east and west coast
he said this one's a bullet you got ta give it run
the chicken said thanks and spanked it #1
he went outside was gettin' props all over
then he dipped into his ride the 4-point rover
raced up the block doin' 83
some cats with hennessey saw him at a r-e-d
he winked his eye like his star status mattered
they rat-a-tat-tatted to make his blood splatter
you rockin' crazy ice and all you do is cling static
and rollin' down to brooklyn late night is problematic
his eyes was bloody red he hung on every word they said
they told the kid back down that playa shit is dead
deep in his heart he knew he was gone
but he grabbed his 45 and decide to blaze on
wit' shades on founded had him astounded an'
before long the young man got surrounded
those grabbed the guns so goes the glory
and that is the way i got ta end this story
he was out chasin' cream and the american dream
tryin' to pretend the ends justify the means
this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
it's just what comes to pass when you sell your ass
life is more than what your hands can grasp

the young gifted and black are sprung addicted to crack
all my people where y'all at cause y'all ain't here
and your hero's using your mind as a canvas to paint fear
with broad brush strokes and tales of incarceration
you get out of jail with that knowledge of self determination
stand in ovation cause you put the hue in human
cause and effect effect everything you do
and that's why i got love in the face of hate
hands steady so the lines in the mental illustration is straight
the thought you had don't even contemplate
infinite like figure eight there's no escape

from that what? knowledge of self determination
from that what? knowledge of self determination
from that what? knowledge of self determination

in full effect i stay catchin lyrical rep
and keep it blacker than the back of your neck
what you expect that shit's hollerin
'cause we developin the followin
gettin' played like stone love tapes and dollar vans
order reverse your universe so your demise is first
before your rise it gets worse
you need a night nurse like gregory

visions occupy my synaptic space
command and shake to illustrate my mind's landscape
the tall grass the low plains the mountanous ridges
thickets among the forests rivers beneath the bridges
presence of hilltops lit up with tree tops
eavesdrop and hear the incline of sunshine nine
stones in orbit refuse to forfeit
they all form a cipher and they came to observe it
i follow suit and face it embrace it
shinin bright but still i'm careful not to waste it
destined to rise because i'm basement adjacent
spirit is still so just chill and be patient
some heads approach like i'm the one to base with
clowns about to scream and shout but don't say shh
i ain't your student so i ain't to be tested
i'm majestic i represent my strength without effort
my method is unorthodox but of course it rocks
my serious synopsis will drop kick my topics
run the gauntlets and galvanize the audience
i must represent i don't come off with no corniness
it's all luminary despite commentary

you either make a way or stay sobbin' the shiny apple

nightly news repeat who got shot down and locked down

and it's better than slanging in the valley
triple the profit making more than i did in cali
breaking up rocks like barney rubble
'cause them mark-ass niggaz don't want trouble

police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
getting bitches and they can't stand a
1991 tony montana

where it was never seen before
punks run when the gats bust
4 jheri curled niggaz kicking up dust
and some of them are even looking up to us
wearing our colors and talking that gang fuck
giving up much much love
dying for a street that they never heard of
but other motherfuckers want to stand strong
so you know the phrase once again it's on

'cause my son doesn't take no for an answer
now i pay taxes that you never give me back
what about diapers bottles and similac
do i gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack
for decent shelter and clothes on my back?

just like a jimmy hat's used for protection
i use my nine when suckers start to flex it
'cause if you run up and try to play mine
i rather have a ak than a fucking k9
'cause if you shot your gun and my dog tries to fetch ya
me and the dog's going out on a stretcher

just in case the little punks try to jack
i can't put a motherfucking pitbull under a coat

it'll probably work a 100 percent better
'cause it'll keep me out of danger
with sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber
so this goes to all y'all intruders
beware of the owner 'cause the owner is a shooter
i don't just wanna give your ass rabies
i rather have your ass pushing up daisies
and i can't do that with benji
rin tin tin or spotch mckinsey

they call my name and put me on icu
halfway dead
no respect and handcuffed to the bed

only got a band-aid and an iv
that's when i start cussin

i knew it was a caper
i said please don't kill my mother so he raped
her
tied me up took me outside
and i was thrown in a big truck
and it was packed like sardines
pull of niggers who fell for the same scheme
took us to a place and made us work
all day and we couldn't have shit to say
broke up the families forever
and to this day black folks can't stick together
and it's odd broke us down made us pray to his

it makes me say damn i wanna kill sam

yeah get a little money and moves out the neighborhood and shit
but you still ain't shit

when you first start rhyming
it started off slow and then you start climbing
but it wasn't fast enough i guess
so you gave your other style a test
you was hardcore hip-hop
now look at yourself boy you done flip-flopped
giving our music away to the mainstream
don't you know they ain't down with the team
they just sent they boss over
put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over
on mtv but they don't care
they'll have a new nigga next year
you out in the cold
no more white fans and no more soul
and you might have a heart attack
when you find out the black folks don't want you back
and you know what's worse?
you was just like the nigga in the first verse
stop selling out your race
and wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face
niggas always gotta show they teeth
now i'm a be brief
be true to the game

break
yeah motherfucker
i see you got your fancy cars and shit
but you know what?
you still ain't shit
that's right i caught you slipping
you know i could've gat you
yeah but i didn't even trip

a message to the oreo cookie
find a mirror and take a look g
do you like what you see?
but you're quick to point the finger at me
you wanna be the big fish you little guppy
black man can't be no yuppie
you put on your suit and tie and your big clothes
you don't associate with the negroes
you wanna be just like jack
but jack is calling you a nigga behind your back
so back off genius
i don't need you to correct my broken english
you know that's right
you ain't white
so stop holding your ass tight
cause you can't pass
so why you keep trying to pass?
with your black ass
mister big
but in reality you're shorter than a midge
you only got yourself to blame
get a grip oreo and be true to the game

and ice cube practices what he preaches
he continues to live in south central los angeles
and he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood

be true to the game",2
19,"ice cube
here's another day at the stoplight
i'm lookin' in my mirror so i can see who can see me
south central is puttin' ice cube to the test
with four brothas in the ss
now i can't go around and can't back up
so i gotta peep game layin in the cut
is this a jack or a kidnap?
since i'm never ever slippin i'm fully strapped
i grab my gat out the glove
do these fools got a problem with me or do they got love?
and when the light turn green i don't bone out
i wanna see what these black men are all about
'cause if it's my time i'm just short
if not i'm pluggin they super sport
first they get behind my ride
then they switch lanes to the left side
i'm scopin out the one smokin' indo'
comin' up fast rollin' down his window
he threw up a sign i put away my nine
fool 'cause i'm color blind

threat
killa cali the state where they kill
over colors 'cause brothas don't know the deal
and they'll cap you not if they have to
but if they want to first they might confront you
but every nigga on my block can't stop
and he won't stop and he don't stop
not to the bang bang boogie but they like to gangbang
and rookies ain't the only ones that drop
some say the little locs are gettin' a little too loc'ed
and when it comes to dust they kick up the most
say the wrong words then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
bust a u-turn come back and get served nigga
for the women it don't matter how loud they blouse get
but wearin the wrong color outfit could get your mouth split
it's a shame but it ain't no thang to me
'cause i slang these thangs like a g
it's on is anybody killin' for the summertime
i gotta get another nine even though i'm colorblind

kam
i'm fresh outta county on bail
and no sooner do i get out seems like i'm right back in jail
for some gang related activity
'cause everyday different fools try to get with me
for no more than a color or territory
can't rehabilitate 'em that's the sheriff's story
so what's left the judge goes deaf
when you try to tell your side and you ain't blue eyed
boy you better duck 'cause the book is comin'
and just hand your car keys over to your woman
because it ain't no sunshine where you headed
and the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it
but now i got time to think
because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
and i ain't even shed a tear
'cause believe it or not they got more love for me here
now picture that but on a black and white photograph
'cause brothas you don't know the half
on the streets i was damn near outta my mind
but ever since i've been down i'm colorblind

wc
now here's the game plan yo at a quarter to nine
i was told to peel a cap on the other side
yo young and dumb and full of come up a baby loc
i gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke

coolio
stable and able but i'm not ready and willin'
'cause i'm only 13 and i ain't never did a killin'
grabbed the ak and jumped in the g ride
started up the bucket and headed for the other side

wc
yo spotted the enemies now i'm on a creep tip
hit the 5 dollar stick and i put in my clip

coolio
so i jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
i had my mind set on sendin niggaz to harrisons ross

wc
caught one from the back and i looked in his eyes
thinkin' should i peel his cap or should i let him survive
yo i'm trapped in the plan designed by the other kind

coolio
i ain't contributin' to genocide why? 'cause i was colorblind

king tee
niggaz in the hood ain't changed
and i've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang
'cause i walk the alleys of compton with nowhere to turn
every which way i get burned baby
lou wears blue big fred wears red
put 'em together and we color 'em dead
dead dyin' gettin' smoked like part of the fun
they get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral

j-dee lench mob
i understand how all my homeboys feel
'cause i've been shot and to this day i pack my steel
'cause i was born in a certain territory
where you don't talk only the streets tell stories
with blue and red bandanas on the street
and if you're slippin you'll be six feet deep
'cause me and t-bone we pay it no mind
and for the rest of the mob we stay color blind",2

to say you're guilty your fingerprints filthy
deliver me the gun i'll tie two quickly throw it in the river
make sure it's safe to the bottom
our smart police snuck you out at the projects we got em

repeat to fade",2
7,"verse one prodigy

it all began on the street to the back of a blue police vehicle
next come the bookends the way things is looking
it's friday you in for a long stay gettin' shackled on the bus
first thing come monday hoping in your mind you'll be released one day
but knowing home is a place you're not going for a long while
now you're up on the isle in a position that you ain't got to refusing
to smile
but keep in mind there's a brighter day after your time spent
used to be wild but locked up you can't get bent
thought you could hack it now you're requesting pee see you fragile
it ain't hard to see niggas like that don't associate with me
i'd rather get busy to the third degree
cause the war populations are
if this was the street my razor would be a mack demon
hit you up leave your whole face screaming what you in for kid
busting nuts taps heard of million street stories caught inside this trap
who are you to look at me with your eyes like that
wising up young blood before you make things escalate and i would hate
to set your crooked ass straight

make your moves at night pack your heat in this warzone niggas is trife
runnin' from one time ain't no time to slip make one false move
and it's a up north trip
livin' the high life make your moves at night pack your heat in this warzone
niggas is trife runnin' from one time ain't no time to slip make one
false move and it's a up north trip

verse two havoc

you tried to dip duck but still got bucked you talk too much shit
you should have kept your mouth shut all that gossip
motherfucker don't you know my glock kicks hollow tips
to your body mad toxic i fade you blow you with a rusty-ass razor
did you a favor tried to wet you but i grazed you
pop goes the glock when there's beef on the block chill for a while
make them think the beef stop then i creep like a thief in the night
it's only right ain't no turnin' back it's on tonight and if i get caught
then my ass is up north straight on the course for upstate new york
stress smokin' back to back cigaretttes it popped off gon' point in
the mess hall
but to avoid that from head to toe dipped in all black hit them niggas
where they pump they cracks at havoc with the murder masterplan
keep my nine up to par so my shit won't jam god forbid if my shit do
run behind a tree fix my shit then hit you slugs in your body
mainly in your brain tissue witness from the scene get ghost stash
the pistol
so simple then watch my back lay up and relax roll a sack ?k-a black?
find a shorty intact

verse three prodigy

i got the powder combine wit the powder and water it oughtta
drop in a half and hour in the form of oil watch the cocaine boil
keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil then i pause
and ask god why did he put me on the serve just so i could die
i sit back and build on all the things i did wrong why i'm still breathing
and all my friends gone i try not to dwell on the subject for a while
'cause i might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle but my
heart pumps foul blood through my arteries and i can't turn it back
it's a part of me too late for cryin i'm a grown man struggling
to reach the next level of life without fumbling down to folding
i got no shoulder to lean on but my own all alone in this danger zone
time waits for no man the streets grow worse fuck the whole world kid
my money comes first 'cause i'm out for the gusto and trust nobody
if you're not family then you die by me cause niggas will have you
locked up
the snitch be a man givin' police the run down on your plans
we're never goin' down like that so i shut my mouth and hold my words back
the legal business forever mine fuck payin' taxes the last kid that shitted

and gave police access to my blueprints used names as evidence
skipped town and i haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
the moral of the story is easy to figure out a lesson that you can't
live without

that's when i got the call from this brownskin shorty
she asked me where's my crew at? said we could do whatever
she got her crew too and said that we should get together
i said aight -- just call me back in a hour
so i can take a shower and gather up the manpower
then i hung up the horn
and i thought to myself that it might be on
cause this trick ain't pick up the phone to call me in years why?
ever since i left the hoe lonely in tears
ain't no tellin' what her friends puttin' up in her ears
ideas of settin me up i'm not tryin' ta hear
check it out son so we take the gats for precautions
plus this trick live in brooklyn home of the coffin
she might got a whole batallion of bucktowners
waitin for us to get up off the train and surround us
or maybe i'm blowin' this shit out of proportion
but this shit do happen to niggaz very often
so fuck it a nigga gotta do what he meant to
my crew got my back fuck the world is my mental
we put together five soldiers the bitch called
my blood curdled told me to meet her on myrtle
got to the plaza we're waitin for the g train
we put a plan together just in case the beef came
now we bed stuy bound
far from home and on unknown ground
but together we six deep with fire piece nuttin sweet
first nigga frontin gettin' lifted off his fuckin' feet
it took eternity we reached our destination
my heartbeat is racin like a cardiac patient
we finally got to myrtle outside the train station
i saw not a soul told my peoples to be patient
but hold up that's when a black caravan rolled up
my legs then froze up i grabbed my pound
told my man eyes open cause it might go down
said he don't like the way the shit is startin to sound
evey angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
so we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it

jetted through marcy cause dee's ain't baggin me

everything is real inside my mind these days
you can't make it if you ain't affiliated with crime
a lifetime of street living
throughout the beef i've accumulated many slugs have been given
but wilding ain't the way to be living
you're only gonna end up bloody on a floor shivering
or locked up caught inside the beast
meanwhile on the street saying no more peace
my man sto-bo kid hold your own
in a cell locked down not far from home
and at the same time on the outside i'm representing
still packin heat make you cowards keep stepping
getting high it's cause of the lye i can't lie
i could move the crowd poppin' slugs in the sky
why come around if you afraid of what's over here
my man havoc put the bug in my ear
on the real for real but wait it gets realer

regardless of your name or what you been through
pause for a second open your eyes and think dude

verse one prodigy

i used to be in love with this bitch named e&ampj
don't fuck with her anymore now i fuck with tanqueray
tanqueray introduced me to her first cousin gold
last name was ide's and the first name old
but gold couldn't take the dick and made me lazy
we split apart and now i met this new trick dany
now me and dany we been together ever since
our love combines to form a science what is this
i bust a cherry took her virginity in ninety-one
now that she's open everybody want to tap somethin'
go get your own don't make me have to fuckin' clap somethin'
i love my shorty more than life now ain't that somethin'
so love you dany more than livin' itself
even though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health
when i go pick her up they tell me put her back on the shelf
they say say yo p she only wants you for one thing that's your wealth
but i don't pay attention she's my baby the dany
you know she drive me crazy she's my number one lady
met her back in eighty-nine now she's twenty-two
actin' like she forty she said all i need is a man to support me
besides you from the 41st side of things
and queensbridge niggaz be actin' like they kings
pushin lexus' wearin fat diamond rings
my cellular phone reigns supreme international think rational
the 12th street crew move back when we come through

i think the whole world's goin' insane
i fill my brain up with dany and drink away the pain
i think the whole world's goin' insane
i fill my mind up with liquor and drink away the pain
i think the whole world's losin it's brain
i fill my brain up with liquor and drink away the pain
i think the whole world's goin' insane
i fill my brain up with dany and drink away the pain

verse two q-tip

tommy hil was my nigga and other's couldn't figure
how me and hilfiger used to move through with vigor
had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures
said the brinks is comin' through at fashion avenue
at tuesday at two now we gotta form a crew
now we gotta forum a crew of motherfuckers
who ain't goin' out like suckers
told me call karl kani and all my other brothers
i told my sister walker who was the smoothest talker
negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers
diesel drove the the beemer the hatchback of course
nautica'll navigate to keep us on course
polo's acting bolo trying to say he the boss
i said shut the fuck up the kid is out where the loot's at
got a big trey pound picture just to swoop back
timb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle
scope is on the top so you know he livin' eiffel
took the aim of oswald caught him north in the face
all them other kids they had they tools aimed at space
levi had the snub so you know they gettin' laced
donna karan was cryin cause mad shells was flyin
damn all we want is a piece of the pie and
nike scooped the sess 'cause he moves like air
threw them shits up in the trunk now we up out here
got back to the mansion to divvy up the paper
helle hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper
so she felt it was right for her to get the whole slice
everybody in the crew didn't think it was nice
i guess not and guess what's hot so guess what
guess took the jigga and jigged her in the gut

when you play with crime sometime's it's not too fly
even though the goods look deceivin to the eye
the end situation could leave your ass dry
that's why you got to walk on by walk on by
walk on by walk on by walk on by

speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
you can put your whole army against my team and
i guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
your simple words just don't move me you're minor we're major
you all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
don't make me have to call your name out your crew is featherweight
my gunshots'll make you levitate
i'm only nineteen but my mind is old
and when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold
another nigga deceased another story gets told
it ain't nothin' really hey yo dun spark the phillie
so i can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas
why they still alive i don't know go figure
meanwhile back in queens the realness is foundation
if i die i couldn't choose a better location
when the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation
getting closer to god in a tight situation now
now take these words home and think it through
or the next rhyme i write might be about you

queensbridge niggas don't play i don't got time
for your petty thinking mind son i'm bigga than those
claimin' that you pack heat but you're scared to hold
and when the smoke clears you'll be left with one in your dome
13 years in the projects my mentality is what kid
you talk a good one but you don't want it
sometimes i wonder do i deserve to live
or am i going to burn in hell for all the things i did?
no time to dwell on that 'cause my brain reacts
front if you want kid lay on your back
i don't fake that kid you know i bring it to you live
stay in a child's place kid you out o' line
criminal minds thirsty for recognition
i'm sippin' e&ampj got my mind flippin'
i'm buggin' think i'm how bizarre to hold my hustlin'
get that loot kid you know my function
'cause long as i'm alive i'ma live illegal

every day of my life since 11-2-74
on the street makin' non-stop cream galore
packin heat stickin up weed stores and more
collectin interest off of extortions to settle my score
it gets deeper when things get real
i'm down to stickin out west bank for my mill
and i'm from hampstead it's close to the shacks of park south
well i'll be outside slingin you're always high
and don't come around to the crossroads of life
we're to the death you and me this beef for eternity
i'm goin' out to the fullest extent
so far into my troubles it's hard for me to get back
to my everyday self and composure
catch you when you open then i bring you to a closure
put ice on a razor and freeze ya when ya shelter
i went for ya grill but you dent from my ?rolder?
i know this kid who says he knows ya because of that
now i know where ya lay ya hat at and that's that
say no more i put it on you while you was yawning
murder without warning the very next morning

once we step through the door party over that's the endin
you and your crew'll leave out a bunch of dead men
bump me and i'll bump you back
you ain't tough black niggas like you just get their life jacked
but i'ma cool nigga till you push me through the limit
but try ta play me and ya ass i get up all in it

'who is this on my mind?' i was thinkin'
then i realised it was my dun playin' 911
once i seen the numbers i ran for the fuckin' guns
my dun in trouble i be there on the double
i jumped up in the bubble yo kid where are you?
1-14 between manhattan and morningside avenue
this happened just right out the blue
aiyo dun fuck that bitch tell her get off your dick
but she's cryin and she says she has feelins and shit
yo it's a settup them niggas got me fed up
ty stay in the buildin if they move fuckin' buck em
get up off the scene you know what i mean?
and hide yourself down with them other fuckin' sixteen
glock and get off they block
then i hung up the cellular ready to rock
and it's on

yo you get deaded in the streets kid set it
you gots no credit fool you get wetted
up with the semi-auto mac double love it
'did he shoot eleven or twelve?' is what he wondered
nigga i got one more shot you must be drinkin'
put the heater to his head watch him start blinkin
'am i goin' to heaven or hell?' is what he's thinkin'
switch to a bitch as his life start sinkin
down to a level of no return
pull out the heat 'cause when the slugs hit it definitely burns
now chill and think about your life for real
every member of my crew is livin' life for real
got your self fucked into somethin' that you couldn't finish
up against the fulliest squad and get diminished
i'm from q-u-e another e-n-s

y'all know the dynasty the roots repertoire
the lieutenant from the reservoir serve the spar
the injurar preditar of a competitar
i send mcs where the paramedics are
at first i'm like nah i'm nonchalant from afar
then strike to cut the fake rap star jugular
with irregular balance of the cat burgla-rar
known to parlay with garcia vega cigars
i know the flavor because me and the thugs minds are mutual
we congruent lay on the corner with the trauma unit
i'm from the lab where the bomb's distibuted
so never try to duplicate the skills executed
son you'd get electrocuted from the worldwide reputed
shine like nickel heat that blow your mind when i shoot it
some know me as the man that's from the roots crew
others as the bad lieutenant of snyder avenue
we go an eye for an eye
behead like a samurai that'll command the dynasty until he die
who will imply that i lack a-biliti?
make your words known amplify the u-tiliti
i'm crooked like the i on a toxic malt liquor
the land whipper the dom perignon champ sipper
the fifth'll bring it all together like the zipper on a butter leather
the bad lieu a bring the bad weather
so to whoever got riff let it rest
reflect then recollect on the way it was set
it's the veteran architect that flows with the rhythm of sex
be on the low shotgun in the lex
with my man low to flex
i'm restin where they handle the tecs
and the lyrical vandal is next flow
so my man my mizza my man

when i breaststroke your wavelength of intensity

your whole vicinity i contaminate with hate
got no time to debate but hold up wait sit straight
it's in mil the elicit you violate you get a ticket
mcs you can't tell i expel you get evicted
from out your misery serve your ass with my delivery
allah makes the ground you steppin on shivery
permanent tears run through your thoughts you queers
it's all upstairs where there's a crowd table and chairs
for years been on the mic i'm like a dike with stairs
when i strike i stay severe niggaz stay low in they glare
from over here my range rover square to blast offside
switch the pitch from southpaw to unorthodox

rabbis monks and priests always pray for peace
but it's deceased now only lives the true realance
open up the mental deaths you rented through my palace
my thoughts contain the plus sign plus the malice
not equating to your wonderland so fuck alice
my style is hostile on the external
but got plenty of love and warmth that's internal
the sin coronal
surfaces from whispers from the lower
my noun like arks and 950 years of noah
you're arch rival
you burn a cross i burn the bible
because i'm liable to do this
when my actions true this
but i'd rather choose to use my diction
resurrect that blond blue eyed and put him through another crucifixion
stay up in your jurisdiction say what?
my depiction is the drama
though these eyes i've seen the trauma
homicides in the source that was phenomenal
when i find out who banged muwan in his abdominal
met with jesus to learn to burns not commical

cause an earthquake and make you shake you need neurology

imagin' with my badge i snatch the pagent
turn your city to a smashing and grab it
now it's time to burn the maggots my message stronger than elisha
that backslap the ass like your father
why bother?
would any care for lyrics i sling from my mic with cease your laughter
mind of a bachelor to a master
what i thought that leaves you flabbergasted
ask you what's the matter bastard?
these types of rhythms man you'd rather blast it
you hear the beats in jeeps over the weekend
silence is golden and niggas get killed just for speakin'
the only deacon is death when ya left wounded
layin' on the ground and meet your doom quick
i done been through the deserts of hell with satin sittin' waitin'

they not secure as they supposed i watched it all unfold
well this another episode with titanic panoramic view is dismantle
depressin um - load with this gun hold
wild like a sun sold for cash
guns traded for sensi and hash crack for ass
entire crews pass not making the news flash
brews pass a memory and spark not to blast
whatever have transform to the war path
pure wrath from north down to 24th and task
games store the half the niggas you were prayin' the streets
tainted with camoflouge - guerilla sabotoge
my cousin's da ratatard was livin' tight large
got caught then blast crashed off on broad and lambar
so many so called hearts scared they buried in the yard
lick shots at babylon de one comfy bombard
kids run far from traditional credit cards scams
veterans is nipped in the butt with large plans
stick up kids is jumpin' outta played the dodge rams to jam
you and your man it's mad drama and -

this is for all of my niggas that are rip
you ain't missin' of life ain't what this should be
i pass a car soon you know who's the enemy
lots of shit has changed and it's kinda fucked up to see
you remember top c nigga think slice of dream
yo i'm fast for the buck do anything for the cream
never seen a case like this although it's quite contageous
he even got his little bother actin' all outrageous
from dusk to dawn and from dawn back to dusk
they do anything and everything tryin' to come up
it's kinda sicknin how the cash is so fucking addicted
and when i say some bout they say that that's conflicted
ain't nothin' but a contradiction in this world we live in
cause the loot is for the takin' and not for the givin'
then ya got this world well i say i'ma die hustlin
fuck everybody except my brother who i'm trusted in
i guess the couple just did not know the truth
cause the following week i seen threw him of the roof
and sometimes i wonder what the fuck i think about that
how nowadays kids get whap for somethin' less than a pat
but i guess that's how it goes when there ain't no more rap
thought he was his borthers keep but fuck all that
niggas causin mayhem from the pm's to am's
americas worst nightname guns against hands

it was the year a 84 i was tryin' ta get in the mix
the year the niggas roll with sheepskins kitcells and kicks
even got the patten leather adidas snatched of your feet
man that talk is cheap the cripled can't walk for weeks
the first sto was word to penn and teller's
strolled in the dollar house parties and search for cinderella
was just a little man real bold
tryin' to act grown and old so da respect can be shown
a hip hop a little copped in and break dancin'
when niggas wore wind breakers plot to take lamb skins
remeber zigglers? uptown the bottom to natrona and
st charles in south phil the ooh mob gang
h-r-m ogontz ave brickyard to hollow
niggas was snatchin gazzeles and flippin pockets for tha dallo
you run ya little wolf chain in west oak lane
and niggas from logan came to extort we know tha game
you proclaim this gangster bullshit talk
and never even seen your man shot a bodies in charge
aggravated assault another weekend in the precinct
take everybody for their ring man that's how we think
back then you catch a sucker punch off guard
niggas will pull you card tryin' to walkaround all hard
niggas quick to flip your pockets if you lip service
when you see fifty niggas deep with scully's get nervous
it ain't no tellin' what they could do to you
so you clutch up thinkin' you knowin' you gettin' stuck up

that's all the fraud shit got to go/fake shit gots to go

verse one

in the glow of the moon over the melancholy metro
my poetry is set like a ufo
the maestro the lyricist concerto
my physical play the role of a vessel
the level of my lyrics law manifesto
my thoughts wrestle and attack with the killer instincts
of a gorilla stronger than samson
without vanilla my soliloquoy profess my ability to just
stimulate you like the best sensimilla
the halflife the illadel-l-p-o-phila proceed
hither is my death flower blow your tower to smithe-

deeper than the meditations of a hidden worshiper
unorthodox hip-hop minister

you lose your balance when the sound hits ya
so check for the fifth militia
a poet's under pressure stressing that you get the picture
even if it means you gotta hang over the banister
i pull a microphone on any pistol brandisher
and take advantage of ya because you amateur
styles gunning down your sound man and manager
what?? this how we do it in the year for nine-six
with this delivering attack on pointless rap shit
breakin mc's down to fractions tell your squadron
it's time to go to war we spar reaction

verse two

the implorer the universe explorer
treat mc's like the cities of sodom and gomorrah
leavin' these niggaz open like a box of pandora
with styles that's newer than the world order
approximately three quarters of y'all are water
i straight deport ya
then orchestrate your torture with roots of culture
the pill brimmage to the line of scrimmage up against your image
where life is a heist and the strong get a percentage
it's ill as a war and within it i'm the lieutenant
that surrounds you like a peninsula to snatch the pennant
you fold like japan's futons and fans
while i design a plan to make a rapper step like a pedestrian
i crush a mountain into grands of sand
your pain stains the cannon of the mic inserted into the stand
the desperado that refuse to follow
the lip afficianado break you up into parts like a bottle
i deep like the dark of the night
niggaz is sweet and sound silly when they talk on the mic
they use the simple back and forth the same
old rhythm that's plain
i'd rather ultramagnetize your brain
it's the hip-hop purist that leave you lost like a tourist
inside the chorus niggaz is bringin' nothin' for us
as we breakin 'em down to fractions tell your squadron
it's time to go to war we spar reaction",2

niggaz run up on you with guns snatchin papers
outlined body chalk is how they would scrape ya
from off the pavement i hate gettin' locked up
cause that upstate bus reminds me of the slave ships
but then the bible never saved shit
i guess that's why every juvenile is in the same predicament
you wanna slang crack or hold tecs and do the concept
you can't make loot when your moms is smokin' up the product
i try to tell ya don't let these streets fuckin' fail ya
the way niggaz be gettin' clapped shit'll fuckin' scare ya
but in the dark we ran wild so we killin' em
niggaz scared can't stand still like fuckin' helium
fake niggaz they don't go platinum they go aluminum
got 'em cloned the fuck up son that's why we losin em
i'm lookin' at this niggaz longevity
to make a big play but then it might be a mistake
'cause if i get sent to dc i'm sendin dice to de

some cats believe they mc but we know they all fraud
do a show in philly niggaz wouldn't applaud
nobody know your record nor who you openin for
can tell your squad's artificial while approachin the door
so you should prepare for lyrical terror that's pure
step up to the reservoir of the soul proprietor style
messiah or the higher law down with dice raw
the matador shorty conniseur
stompin whatever you build to the floor
similar to that of a dinosaur
i told you i'm the rap predator
you insist to imitate what for?
superstar niggaz is ten percent real ninety percent invented
for a fuckin' record deal
comin' with somethin' veterans can't feel
i hit you like a steel anvil
because you grafted off the next man's skill
but still i remain mellow seein the theatrics of othello
run over tactics of the

the phoniest cats is felonious word

verse three dice raw

dice raw the juvenile lyricist corner store terrorist
block trooper conniseur of fine cannabis
focus never weak blow up the spot like plastique
leave a nigga shook to the point he won't speak
never half-assed always live and direct
on bitches try to punk smell the panty and raw sex
mad lights i had to black out when fake niggaz act out
or step out of place they get slapped in they face
all y'all niggaz is fake tryin' to emulate my style
what grown man? in this game to me you're a child
i trained wack mc's in camps like ex-marines
why the fuck you think you went home and had bad dreams
of horrifying things that your ass never seen before?
you traveled to the realm of dice raw
where clones get they dome blown with chrome microphones
it's not your fault black just the fact you wasn't shown
you'll come through this like a smurf
i got you rollin' stop off the earth
represent while i been like this since birth
and i won't be the last but i definitely was the first

knuckle games and hammer cocked ain't nothing sweet or soft
win lose or draw to the jaw take one
deranger lyrical launcher or station
no conversation is needed my task completed
read a nigga up and down in the cut where i'm seated
snatch you from your cloud of cannabis you ignoramuses
you laid on your lap when i attack your glamorous
lifestyle i banged your head up with the white fowl
my character a product of this two-one-fifth trife style
i breeze through areas niggaz would fear to walk in
balance the talkin' that galactic style as of a falcon
your star trek ass will wrinkle
spill these words and form into a sprinkle

with ammo and artillery and stash spots to keep and store it
i used the banner of a slant with a zort
change your strategic plan my man's getting bored
your vocal chord is fraudulent and not the true porcelain

i knew this girl named alana with mad persona

alana was a marylan' thurough and attractive
shorty that's relaxed with me and kickin back
wif a phat flick to cool out
was stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
and go the old school route
but all-a that cease - when that piece checkin' the jewel out
a bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
let the shorty hit me wif a massage to anoint
lubricatin my maridian points that was the summer easy to remember
alana was all up on - to read the gender how i used to back bender
she even told her best friend blinda from virginia
who asked me if i had a cousin i could recommend-a
but as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
when i began to do tours we lost contact
and slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
it keep me feelin' heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
addicted to her presence like a narcotic
though i wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
that faded like a dream sequence that persuaded
beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
comps are dated - i concentrated
on how to get in touch with her
cause the fact of the matter remain that i miss the hypnotic

to make the story short me and my man soon ran
into each other von the humble at a show in san fran
i said yo palma when did you last see alana?
he offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
when he began to break it down my mind start to wander
response beyond somber incredible crushed
kinda feelin' on my shoulder - that of a boulder
to find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
i thought i could get wif her when she was a little older
but she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it's all chaotic

fuck kill and prosper
is the gospel of wonderland where
street sands are quick
to suck you down to the abyss
with the lure of pure bliss if you kiss the dicks
of the niggaz? never nosferatu's
those witches and warlocks in blue
government gumshoe keepers of the first zoo
who?  me? 
i'm the modern day vixen vampire slayer
unauthorized player in the capitalist contest
to see who gets money
no milk and honey in this land
cause justice has been banned
so it's play dirty or die by the hand
that's holding all the guns
plunged deep into religion was my first decision
to save me and my daughter's lives but
i can't thrive off spirit and scripture
the picture grew clearer i made the move to rear her
in a life wanting for nothing
so i got into this drug thing
not doing but dealing
sealing fates and healing struggle gaped wounds
of the doomed became my mission
izm was just too small time
i had to find the best design to
fuck with the massive motherfuckers minds and pockets
so i sold ? kits and alleyway thigh splits for two bits
and five year old preschool pussy
and once strong now bony backs and stretched out
weary racks of snatch in other words
 i sold crack
morality was buried deep beneath the new jeep
silk sheets and money heaps
still the good mother i sent my daughter off to
boarding school to keep shit under cover
all the while envisioning myself a champion of ghetto causes
plus his game i was playing and winning
while sinning against myself and soul to get the gold
i was the female don the crack queen
to me i seemed unstoppable my coffers full
i went buckwild wanting more
like the pipe worn whores i began to deplore
no time for playing with my coochie
counting my man's mad lucci
while he was up inside some hoochie's loose piece
i signed the checks and i counted out the cash
wasn't saving ass for no niggaz sent upriver
i thought my shit was tight
 till my empire started to quiver
taking every chance under surveillance being listened to
and watched like assata shakur
my place on the top was no more sure
loose lips flipped the script
the fantasy trip swiftly ended
it took no time to blend in with the population prison
my jaded vision busted like a cherry
every dream i had now tainted bad
i fucked and i killed to prosper
upheld each tenant of the ghastly gospel
shift to a different wonderland to pay the price for my vice
a land of fields to toil in like slaves
no lillies in this field just plenty of souls to save
plenty of fat uniformed rats with
below average size cocks that slither
through cell locks in the night
lactating tits being licked left and right

beat up and battered they pull me out

fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys for years
i've been used in robberies giving niggaz heart to follow me
placing peoples in graves funerals made 'cause i was sprayed
i was laid in a shelf with a grenade
met a wrecked-up teck with numbers on his chest that say
five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
had a serial defaced hoping one day police would place
where he came from a name or some sort of person to claim him
tired of murdering made him wanna be a plain gun

i make myself jam right in my owner's hand

yo weeks went by and i'm surprised
still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
besides me it's bullets two vests and then a 9
there's a grenade in a box and that teck that kept crying
'cause he ain't been cleaned in a year he's rusty as clear
he's bout to fall to pieces cause of his murder career
yo i can hear somebody coming in open the shelf
his eyes bubbling he said it was on
i felt his palm troubled him shaking
somebody stomped him out his dome was aching
he placed me on his waist the moment i've been waiting
my creation was for blacks to kill blacks
it's gats like me that accidentally go off making niggaz memories
but this time it's done intentionally
he walked me outside saw this cat cocked me back said remember me?
he pulled the trigger but i held on it felt wrong
knowing niggaz is waiting in hell for him
he squeezed harder i didn't budge sick of the blood
sick of the thugs sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
what the other kid did was pull out no doubt
a newer me in better shape before he lit out he lead the chase
my owner fell to the floor his wig split so fast
i didn't know he was hit it's over with
heard mad niggas screaming niggaz running cops is coming

life
i wonder
will it take me under
i don't know

verse one nas

imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
imagine going to court with no trial
lifestyle cruising blue bahama waters
no welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
days are shorter nights are colder
feeling like life is over these snakes strike like a cobra
the world's hot my son got knocked evidently
it's elementary they want us all gone eventually
trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
if coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars
imagine everybody flashing fashion
designer clothes lacing your clique up with diamond role's
your people holding dough no parole no rubbers
going raw imagine law with no undercovers
just some thoughts for the mind
i take a glimpse into time watch the blimp read the world is mine

chorus lauryn hill nas

if i ruled the world
imagine that
i'd free all my sons
i love 'em love 'em baby
black diamonds and pearls
could it be if you could be mine we'd both shine
if i ruled the world
still living for today in these last days and times

verse two nas

yo it'll be paradise life relaxing black latino and anglo-saxon
armani exchange the range
cash lost tribe of shabazz free at last
brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path
the villa houses for the crew how we do
trees for breakfast dime sexes and benz stretches
so many years of depression make me vision
the better living type of place to raise kids in
opening eyes to the lies history's told foul
but i'm as wise as the old owl plus the gold child
seeing things like i was controlling clique rolling
tricking six digits on kicks and still holding
trips to paris i civilized every savage
gimme one shot i turn trife life to lavish
political prisoner set free stress free
no work release purple m3's and jet skis
feel the wind breeze in west indies
i make coretta scott-king mayor the cities and reverse fiends to willie's
it sounds foul but every girl i meet will go down town
i'd open every cell in attica send 'em to africa

chorus lauryn hill nas

if i ruled the world
imagine that
i'd free all my sons
i love 'em love 'em baby

could it be if you could be mine we'd both shine

and then we'll walk right up to the sun
hand in hand
we'll walk right up to the sun
we won't land
we'll walk right up to the sun
hand in hand
we'll walk right up to the sun
we won't land

verse three nas

you'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
duck down in car seats heat's mandatory
running from jake getting chased hunger for papes
these are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state
wait i had to let it marinate we carry weight
trying to get laced flip the ace stack the safe
millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
making moves in atlanta back and forth scrambler
cause you could have all the chips be poor or rich
still nobody want a nigga having shit
if i ruled the world and everything in it sky's the limit
i push a q-45 infiniti
it wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or b felonies
strictly living longevity to the destiny
i thought i'd never see but reality struck
better find out before your time's out what the fuck?

it hurts don't it a refugee come to your turf
to take over the earth

lauryn
see my rhymes are the type of fly rhymes
that can only get down with my crew
and if you try to take lines and buy grines
we'll show how the refugees do

behold it's my own manifold on your rhymes
two mc's can't occupy the same space at the same time
it's against the law of physics
so weep as your sweet dreams break up like eurythmics rap rejects
my tape deck ejects projectile
whether jew or gentile i rentile percentile
many styles more powerful than gamma rays
my grandma pays like carlos santana plays
black magic woman
so while you fumin' i'm consumin' mango juice under polaris
you just embarrassed 'cause it's your last tango in paris
and even after all my logic and my theory
i add a 'muthafucker' so you ignorant niggas hear me
and remember take notes 'cause i soe my rap oats
for all you bitin' zealots here's a quote

aye another mc lose his life tonight oh
i beg that you prayin' to jesus christ why?
oh lord father don't let him bury we aye

you can try but you can't divide the tribe
these cats can't rap mister author i feel no vibe
the magazine said the girl shoulda went solo
the guy should stop rappin' vanish like menudo
took it to the heart but every actor plays his part
as long as someone was listenin' i knew it was a start
for me to get a chance grab my pen and revamp
do a cameo while everyone do the dance do the dance
quit now 'cause you're runnin' out of luck-a
playin' mister big i'm gonna get you sucka
while you munchin' at your luncheon i'll be plannin'
your assassination and hit you like the dutchman

i compress sound sets my rap dbx
then drop vocals on my four five six amtax
bring terror to the shop of horrors
as she cry 'mi amor' the phantom dies in the opera
and to the youngin's who carry gadgets
and kill six days a week and rest on the sabbath
hold up hold up violence ain't necessary
unless you provoke me then get buried like the great mussolini
and for you bitin' zealots your rap stars are relics
no matter who you damage you still a false prophet",2

well uh git up stand up so what's said you dickhead
see when i was a youngsta used to wear them fuckin' pro keds
my mama made me do it but the devil he made me smart
told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fuckin' starters
in the middle school i was a bigger fool
i wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo thought i was cool
i used to hang out with my daddy's brothers i call them my uncles
they taught me how to smoke herb i followed them when they ran numbers
ever sense i was rosemary's baby
and then i learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
hell i treat 'em all like hoes see i pimped 'em
bitch never had my money so i never whipped 'em
see all the playas came and all the playas went
a playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit bitch
you need to git up git out git somethin'
smoke out 'cause it's all about money money money
yeah i said it a nigga sportin' plats and a braves hat
i hang with rico wade 'cause the dungeon is where the funk's at boy

back up in my crib eat my shit break out quick in my slick
'84 se-dan deville steady bouncin'

keep your eyes peeled for the 'cover unit
'cause they known for jumpin' out of black chevy trucks and through the fog
here come the red dogs i'm bustin' out around the corner in my hog
dippin from the area i'm scared
so one of these bitches might wind up dead

ain't nobody black runnin' but crackers so why i got to register?
i thinkin' of better shit to do with my time

at age 13 start workin at the loadin dock

but i come home bank like hank from lickin' and dippin
doin' dumb shit not knowin' what a nigga know now
yeah that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
i dips over to east point still actin' a fool
wastin' my time in the school i'd rather be shootin' pool
cool is how i played the tenth grade
i thought it was all about mackin hoes and wearin pimp fade
instead of bein in class i'd rather be up in some ass
not thinkin' about them six courses that i need to pass
graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
damn that's fucked up i shoulda listened when my mama told me
that if you play now you gonna suffer later
figured she was talkin' yang-yang so i paid her no attention
and kept missin' the point she tried to poke me with
the doper that i get the more i'm feelin' broke and shit
huh but that don't matter though i am an o-ut-kast

an outkast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world
he is looked at differently
he is not accepted because of his clothes his hair

just to pick up the closest thing and knock the living shit out of he
so if you run up you get done up i'mma end it
throw the gun up out the window see the corner that i bent it
it's just so simple when we get so deep
learn a lesson pick up the album when it hits the streets like

dre
no i ain't never been pimped by the system
that's because i ain't no slave
don't be tryin' to sunbathe never lived off in no cave
bloody old chap and in this head of mine is full of naps
and the only thing i know is how to fuck and how to rap
y'all think i'm stupid 'cause i shoots 'em up like cupid
and if you gave me a basketball i'll show you how to shoot it
my head's polluted 'cause i'm zooted bobbin to the bottom
if a pair of jordan's came out y'all figure that i got 'em
but no i don't because i don't be havin' funds
the gold that i am wearin is really made out of bronze
it weighs a ton and makin' my neck turn green
and i got a criminal record that will never come clean
oh and it seems that i make babies like a rabbit
and then never taking care of them has just become a habit
i grab my tablet and get busy with the pen
y'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin
so you get mad and try to make me inferior
you pissin me off i'm in that ass like interior

look at you what makes you ashamed of bein' black?

nuttin' but love for you my sister
might even know how hard it is no doubt
bein' a woman a black woman at that? no doubt

i'm just sayin' in this white man'z world this song is for y'all
for all those times that i messed up or we messed up

dear sister got me twisted up in prison i miss ya

swearin' one day you might leave me for somebody that's richer

twist the cap off the bottle i take a sip and see tomorrow
gotta make if i have to beg or borrow
readin' love letters late night locked down and quiet
if brothers don't receive they mail best believe we riot

eatin' jack-mack starin' at walls of silence
inside this cage where they captured all my rage and violence
in time i learned a few lessons never fall for riches
apologizes to my true sisters far from bitches

help me raise my black nation reparations are due it's true
caught up in this world i took advantage of you
so tell the babies how i love them precious boys and girls
born black in this white man'z world and all i heard was

who knows what tomorrow brings
in this world where everyone's blind
and where to go no matter how far i'll find
to let you know that you're not alone

bein' born with less i must confess only adds on to the stress
two gunshots to my homie's head dyed in his vest
shot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see
i pass his casket gently askin' is there heaven for g's?

my homeboy's doin' life his baby momma be stressin'
sheddin' tears when her son finally ask that questions
where my daddy at? mama why we live so poor?
why you cryin'? heard you late night through my bedroom door

now do you love me mama? whitey keep on callin' me nigga?
get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when i'm bigger
and still thuggin' in this jail cell missin' my block
hearin' brothers screamin' all night wishin' they'd stop

proud to be black but why we act like we don't love ourselves
don't look around busta you sucka check yourselves
know what it means to be black whether a man or girl
we still strugglin' in this white man'z world

who knows what tomorrow brings
in this world where everyone's blind
and where to go no matter how far i'll find
to let you know that you're not alone

so tell me why you changed to choose a new direction
in the blink of an eye my time away just made perfection
did you think i'd die? not gon' cry why should i care
like we holdin' on to lost love that's no longer there

can you please help me god bless me
please keep my seeds healthy
makin' all my enemies bleed while my g's wealthy
hopin' they bury me with ammunitions weed and shells
just in case they trip in heaven ain't no g's in hell

sister sorry for the pain that i caused your heart
i know i'll change if you help me but don't fall apart
rest in peace to latasha lil' yummy and kato
too much for this cold world to take ended up bein' fatal

every women in america especially black
bear with me can't you see that we under attack
i never meant to cause drama to my sister and mama
hope we make it to better times in this white man's world

all the penitentiaries
mumia mutulu geronimo pratt
all the political prisoners
san quinton
all the jailhouses
i'm with you

yeah
one thug one thug
how do we keep the music playing
one thug one thug

i wake up early in the morning
mind state so military
suckas fantasizing
pictures of a young brother buried
was it me
the weed
or this life i lead
if daytime is for suckas then tonight we breathe
out for all that
knowing that this world brings drawbacks
look how they shiver
once i deliver these war raps
meet me at the cemetery dressed in black
tonight we
honor the dead those who won't be back
so if i die do the same for me
shed no tears
an outlaw thug living in this game for years
why worry?
hope to god
get me high when i'm buried
knowing deep inside only a few love me
don't rush me through the gates of heaven
let me picture for a while
how i lived from my days as a child
i wonder now
how do we outlast always get cash
stay strong if we all mash
hold your head

how do we keep the music playing
you got to hold your head
how do we get ahead
hold your head
too many young black brothers are dying
you got to hold your head
living fast too fast
hahaha

these felonies be like prophecies
begging me to stop
'cause these lawyers getting money every time they knock us
snatch they pockets lyrically
suckas flee when they notice
switched my name to makaveli
had the rap game closed
expose foes with my hocus pocus flows they froze
now suckas idolize my chosen blows
and more money mean litigating
more playa hating
got a cell at the penn for me waiting
is this my fate?
miss me with that misdemeanor thinking
we fall back
never had too much tequilla drinking
we all that
make them understand me
you lie to say my posse
everyone roll with me is family
'cause every bodies got me
watch me paint a perfect vision
this life we living
got us all meeting up in prison
last week i got a letter from my road dog
written in blood
saying please show a young playa love
hold your head
hold it

how do we keep the music playing
you got to hold your head
how do we get ahead
hold your head
too many young black brothers are dying
you got to hold your head
living fast too fast
hahaha

how do we keep the music playing
you got to hold your head
how do we get ahead
c'mon hold your head
too many young black brothers are dying
yes hold hold your head
living fast too fast
weed got me thinking in my mind

god bless the child that can hold is own
indeed
enemies bleed when i hold my chrome
let these words be the last
to my unborn seeds
hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed
currency means nothing if you still ain't free
money breeds jealousy take the game from me
i hope for better days
trouble comes naturally
running from authorities
till they capture me
and my aim is to spread more smiles than tears
utilize lessons learned from my childhood years
maybe mama had it all right
rest your head
straight conversation all night
bless the dead
to the homies that i used to have
that no longer roll
catch a brother at the crossroads
plus nobody knows my soul
watching time pass
through the glass of my drop top rolls
hold your head

how do we keep the music playing
you got to hold your head
how do we get ahead
hold your head
too many young black brothers are dying
you got to hold your head
living fast too fast
hahaha

how do we keep the music playing
you got to hold your head
how do we get ahead
no matter how hard it gets feel me c'mon
hold your head
too many young black brothers are dying

watch the stars get some pussy whatever

0,"bismillah ir rahman ir raheem

if you can hear me ladies and gentlemen then i'm very happy that you came here

ooh-ooh ooh whee
that was for brooklyn
haha we get it every time
you got me on? oh
shout out to all of my crew east-west north-south
all the continent europe all abroad international
bring it in bring it in bring it in bring it in
it's a lot of things goin' on y'all
twenty-first century is comin' twentieth century almost done
a lot of things have changed
a lot of things have not mainly us
we gon' get it together right? i believe that
listen people be askin' me all the time
yo mos what's gettin' ready to happen with hip hop? where do you think hip hop is goin'?
i tell 'em you know what's gonna happen with hip hop whatever's happening with us
if we smoked out hip hop is gonna be smoked out
if we doin' all right hip hop is gonna be doin' all right
people talk about hip hop like it's some giant livin' in the hillside comin' down to visit the townspeople
we are hip hop
me you everybody we are hip hop
so hip hop is goin' where we goin'
so the next time you ask yourself where hip hop is goin'
ask yourself where am i goin'? how am i doin'?
till you get a clear idea

so if hip hop is about the people
and the hip hop won't get better until the people get better
then how do people get better? hmm
well from my understanding people get better
when they start to understand that they are valuable
and they not valuable because they got a whole lot of money
or 'cause somebody think they sexy
but they valuable 'cause they been created by god
and god makes you valuable
and whether or not you recognize that value is one thing
you got a lot of societies and governments
tryin' to be god wishin' that they were god
they wanna create satellites and cameras everywhere and make you think they got the all-seein' eye
eh i guess the last poets wasn't too far off when they said that certain people got a god complex i believe it's true
i don't get phased out by none of that none of that helicopters the tv screens the newscasters the satellite dishes they just wishin'
they can't really never do that
when they tell me to fear they law when they tell me to try to have some fear in my heart behind the things that they do
this is what i think in my mind
and this is what i say to them and this is what i'm sayin' to you check it

all over the world hearts pound with the rhythm
fear not of men because men must die
mind over matter and soul before flesh
angels for the pain keep a record in time
which is passin' and runnin' like a caravan freighter
the world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked
but god is sufficient in disposin' of affairs
gunmen and stockholders try to merit my fear
but god is sufficient over plans they prepared
mos def in the flesh where you at? right here
on this place called earth holdin' down my square
'bout to do it for y'all and y'all at the fair
so just bounce come on bounce
bounce bounce bounce bounce
and just

just step two three

speech is my hammer bang the world into shape
now let it fall hungh
my restlessness is my nemesis
it's hard to really chill and sit still
committed to page i write a rhyme
sometimes won't finish for days
scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
i mathematically add-minister
subtract the wack
selector wheel it back i'm feeling that
ha ha ha from the core to the perimeter black
you know the motto
stay fluid even in staccato
mos def full blooded full throttle
breathe deep inside the trunk hollow
there's the hum young man where you from
brooklyn number one
native son speaking in the native tongue
i got my eyes on tomorrow there it is
while you still try to follow where it is
i'm on the ave where it lives and dies
violently so silently
shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
used to speak the king's english
but caught a rash on my lips
so now my chat just like dis
long range from the base-line switch
move like an apparition
float to the ground with ammunition chi-chi-chi-pow
move from the gate voice cued on your tape
putting food on your plate
many crews can relate
who choosing your fate yo
we went from picking cotton
to chain gang line chopping
to be-bopping
to hip-hopping
blues people got the blue chip stock option
invisible man got the whole world watching
where ya at i'm high low east west
all over your map
i'm getting big props with this thing called hip hop
where you can either get paid or get shot
when your product in stock
the fair-weather friends flock
when your chart position drop
then the phone calls
chill for a minute
let's see who else tops
snatch your shelf spot
don't gas yourself ock
the industry just a better built cellblock
a long way from the shell tops
and the bells that l rocked rock rock rock rock

scratching

hip hop is prosecution evidence
the out of court settlement
ad space for liquor
sick without benefits hungh
luxury tenements choking the skyline
it's low life getting tree-top high
it is a back water remedy
bitter intent to the memory
a class e felony
facing the death penalty hungh
stimulant and sedative original repetitive
violently competitive a school unaccredited
the break beats you get broken with
on time and inappropriate
hip hop went from selling crack to smoking it
medicine for loneliness
remind me of thelonius and dizzy
propers to b-boys getting busy
the war-time snap shot
the working man's jack-pot
a two dollar snack box
sold beneath the crack spot
olympic sponsor of the black glock
gold medallist in the back shot
from the sovereign state of the have-nots
where farmers have trouble with cash crops woo
it's all city like phase two
hip hop will simply amaze you
praise you pay you
do whatever you say do
but black it can't save you",2

the entire affair's probably charged wit emotion

this is far before the days of high glamour and pose
aiyyo power from the street light made the place dark

it was love for the thing that made me stay in the house
spendin time writin rhymes
tryin' to find words that describe the vibe
that's inside the space
when you close yo' eyes and screw yo' face
is this the pain of too much tenderness
to make me nod my head in reverence

to build landmarks here as evidence
nighttime spirit shook my temperament

i need more than to knock it down i'm really trying to lock it down

sitting on their front stoop sipping guinnesses
using native dialect in they sentences
from the treeline blocks to the tenements
to the mom and pop local shop businesses
travel all around the world in great distances

it's off the handle black with big police scandals that
turn into actions screenplays sold to miramax

be blazin' john that have your wave cap floatin' back
the doorstep where the disposessed posted at

we all got to have a place where we come from home a place where someone lives a residence
this place that we come from is called home a residence the physical structure within which one lives such as a house
we set out on our travels we do the best we can a dwelling place with the social unit that occupies it a household
we travel this big earth as we roam an environment offering security and happiness a valued place a native habitat

we all got to have a place where we come from a place where something is discovered founded developed or promoted a source
this place that we come from is called home a headquarters a homebase
and even though we may love this place on the map of or relating to a teams place of origin
said it ain't where ya from it's where ya at on or into the point at which something is directed to the center or the heart

i come up in the street around some real wild brothers
with more than one name and more than one baby mother
more than one case been on more than one run
got more than one enemy and more than one gun
partner all that's left to want is more
while these cats that's less privileged is just more raw
less space 'cause the projects laced with more flaws
less sleep 'cause the nights ain't peace it's more war
the can is raw like thirsty rainy season thunder claps
on the block with your old pop pleading number act
to the spot with the red top fiends is huddled at
to the crib where the little kids spend their summers trapped
with the jungle cats lions and tigers leopards and cheetahs
for gazelle you get chased like a zebra they blaze cheeba-cheeba
and dominate the weaker on the street
hungry bellies only love what they eat and it's hard to compete
when they smile with your heart in they teeth
and the odds is stacked high beyond and beneath
son i been plenty places in my life and time
and regardless where home is son home is mine

laundromat helping ma dukes fold the bed linen
chillin' in front my building with my brother and them
spending nights in bushwick with my cousins and them
wise town and beat street uh federal relief
slowly melting in the morning grits we used to eat
sticking to your teeth and teeth is hard to keep
with every flavor now and later only a dime apiece
old timers on the bench playing cards and thangs
telling tales about they used to be involved in things
start to drinking talking loud cussing up and showing out
on the phone call the cops pick 'em up move 'em out
and it's all too common to start wildin'
i'm a pirate on an island seeking treasure known as silence
and it's hard to find block parties in dark lobbies
funeral homes packed but only dark bodies
i can't sleep hardly stirred up like bob marley
marley marl played the symphony remember we recall
son i been to many places in my space and time
and whatever my home is son home is mine

stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
budget cutbacks but increased police presence
and even if you get out of prison still living
join the other five million under state supervision
this is business no faces just lines and statistics
from your phone your zip code to ssi digits
the system break man child and women into figures
two columns for who is and who ain't niggas
numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
but you push too hard even numbers got limits
why did one straw break the camel's back? here's the secret
the million other straws underneath it it's all mathematics

that makes me know that we we we we're doin'
we had the right idea in the beginning
and and we just need to maintain our focus and elevate
we what we do we update our formulas
we have certain formulas but we update 'em oh right
with the times and everything y'know
and and so y'know
the rhyme style is elevated
the style of beats is elevated
but it's still guru and premier
and it's always a message involved

the real hip-hop
mcing and djing from your own mind ya know?
i i guess right now we should start the show

guru
who's the suspicious character strapped with the sounds profound
similar to rounds spit by derringers
you're in the terrordome like my man chuck d said
it's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
cause mc's have used up extended warranties
while real mc's and dj's are a minority
but right about now i use my authority
'cause i'm like the wizard and you look lost like dorothy
the horror be when i return for my real people
words that split wigs hittin like some double desert eagles
sportin caps pulled low and baggy slacks
subtractin all the rappers who lack over premier's tracks
severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
so as i have in the past i whup ass
droppin' lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
and one-dimensional mc's can't handle that
while the world's revolvin on it's axis
i come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
the wilderness is filled with this so many people
searching for false lift i'm here with the skills you've missed
the rejected stone is now the cornerstone
sort of like the master builder when i make my way home
you know my steez

[method man] you know my steez
let 'em know do your thing y'all keep it live
[flavor flav] to the beat y'all

the beat is sinister primo makes you relax
i'm like the minister when i be lacin the wax
i be bringin' salvation through the way that i rap
and you know and i know i'm nice like that
work through worldly problems i got the healing power
when the mic's within my reach i'm feelin' more power
stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
it's often easier for one to give advice
than it is for a person to run one's own life
that's why i can't be caught up in all the hype
i keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
the apparatus gets blessed and suckers get put to rest
no more of the unpure i got the cure for this mess
the wackness is spreadin like the plague
mc's lucked up and got paid but still can't make the fuckin' grade
how many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
yo they must wanna fry they can't touch the knowledge i personify
i travel through the darkness carrying my torch
the illest soldier when i'm holding down the fort
[method man] you know my steez
you know my steez

let 'em know do your thing y'all keep it live
[method man] you know my steez

on the microphone you know that i'm one of the best yet
some punks ain't paid all of their debts yet
tryin' to be fly ridin' high on the jet-set
with juvenile rhymes makin' fake-ass death threats
big deal like en vogue here's something you can feel
styles more tangible and image more real
for some time now i've held the scrolls and manuscripts
when it's time to go all out you be like damn he flipped
now i'm sick fed up with the bullshit
got the lyrical full clip giving you a verbal asswhip
don't trip it's the gifted prolific one
known as bald head slick -- why is the press all on my di-dick?
my style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
don't try it i'm about to start more than a friggin riot
styles unsurpassable and nuccas that's suckas yo
them motherfuckers are harrassable
for i be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
the mic's either a magic wand
or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
then i grab your palm no pulse you're gone
and if you thought we'd lose our niche in this rap shit you way wrong
i stay up i stay on shine bright like neon
your song's pathetic synthetic like rayon
fat beats they play on want dope rhymes put me on

mmm that's strange i was thinkin' the same thing

has thou seen him who belies religion?
that is one who is rough to the orphan
and no matter what we say our religion is
whether it's islam christianity

verse two guru

i floss my rhymes like dentals my mental's presidential
from the wild ghetto districts to the plush resedential
essential would be the message that i send you

and nowadays i pave the way for troops of my young brothers
necessary by all means sort of like malcolm

though they conspire fake us to make us retire
with the burning desire we make it out of the crossfire
thoughts are higher elevating and focused
while the path is narrow for those like us
primo beats provoke us to meditate like zen
with the will and the strength of a million men
while they introspect where nothing is met
it's been that way for a while so much has come and then went
but i'm confident a few are due to redeem
their respective kingdoms with an abundance of cream
so if i were to scheme it would be on a realer dream
like formin effective teams to filter the smokescreens
you totin in jeans don't even know the true envy
the man i'm pickin' apart and plus they both were friends to me
past trivial pursuits like east and west coast feuds
come against me on the mic many and most will lose
like most dudes i love this hip-hop and this rap stuff
but i don't like the shows where the ignorant act up
while some'll be rippin it they be in the crowd wildin
flippin on kids for the chains and medallions
or the kid they don't like from a beef from way back
and decide that's the night perfect time for payback
it's wack for the group plus the others who came
to see a fat ass show instead there's bullets aflame

quiet as kept they slept we crept

it doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back

it's like sabotage it's got me ready to bust

don't fear things get severe for everybody everywhere
why do bad things happen to good people?
seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil

to think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
now i'm contemplatin in my bedroom pacin'
dark clouds over my head my heart's racin
suicide? nah i'm not a foolish guy
don't even feel like drinking or even gettin' high
cause all that's gonna do really is accelerate

but wait i've been through a whole lot of other shit before
so i oughta be able to withstand some more
but i'm sweatin though my eyes are turnin' red and yo
i'm ready to lose my mind but instead i use my mind
i put down the knife and take the bullets out my nine
my only crime was that i'm too damn kind
and now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
but they can't take the respect that i've earned in my lifetime
and you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
so like they say every dog has it's day
and like they say god works in a mysterious way

as i prepare to meet my moment of truth
you should know the truth
and the truth shall set you free -- from who's gonna take the
weight?

yo lookin' at the situation plainly will you remain g?
or will you be looked upon strangely?

revolvin on the tascam much doper than my last jam

lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
assessments are made before and during combat
i master my hunger blow the spot when i bomb cats
one of us equals many of us
disrespect one of us you'll see plenty of us
conflict is what i predict
you and your fellas is mad jealous attempting to flare
we cleverly stalked ya your fam'll miss ya
the war's on that's why we formed the militia

verse three freddie foxxx

you niggaz owe me for my rhymes i come to collect
for you dope fiend niggaz in rap i here to inject check
my style is butter baby spread it around
but when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
i get down in '89 i spit the buck in the face
of every mc that came in the place a scar you'll never erase
mc's are only recognized for their flows
i'm worldwide for the bitches that i turned into hoes
you heard me spit it on jew-elz that's how it goes
for all them faking ass niggaz and how i bust up they nose
and while your nose is drippin and drainin blood
i be standing over you screamin nigga what what? nigga what?
niggas feel my presence like i'm right in they palm
cause a stormy day is coming when you see me so calm it's on
no more twin glocks they jam up my plays
now its twin 40 calibre walther ppk's
i'm in the control of my game you must respect me like the ref
uh-huh you disrespect gun clicks you get the tech
i turn you fake niggaz on and off like i'm the clapper
i rob so many niggaz they should call me jack the rapper
i'll the illest nigga doing this dead or alive
gloria gaynor on you motherfuckers i will survive
you can try to come at me but do you want the kick back?
you snap inside the cage of a pit and you get bit back huh
my war is so tight my drama so ill
beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
i push these lyrics through any mc and make it burn
so the niggaz who be rhyming next will miss a turn
when you speak of who's the dopest mc i don't come up
but when you speak of who's the livest mc i stay what up what's up?
i got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
do what bitch niggaz do best utfo sample bite
you niggaz can't make up a law that i don't overrule overthrow
prim' brought bumpy these tracks so i can let you know
before i slide i'ma leave you this jewel
even mechanics walk around with they tools
it's the militia",2

intro/chorus guru

it's the message in the song that makes you rock on
some people go to places where they don't belong
whether wrong or right a lot of people fight
but i'm here to bless this mic aight?

verse one guru

i take action the minute that the crowd gets hype
i'm type crashin down like a meteorite
i'm bogart-ing mics and whole stages
destroying mc's dreams from words to whole pages
their rapbooks look more like scrapbooks
with their fictional fairytales and frail ass hooks
a lot of shit has happened since i started rappin'
there's been enough beef and enough gat clappin
there's been mad signs for this brother to heed
and while some choose greed i choose to plant seeds
for your mental spirit and physical temple
bob your head to it there's the water you've been lead to it
bathe in it a long time you've been cravin it
prance to it use your third eye and glance through it
your state of being becoming advanced through it
while others rhyme with no reason i be breezin
their mics i seize them then i try 'em for treason
i used to always like to hang out
now i lounge in the rest writin bombs while tracks bang out
i know you peeped me in the club then
but now i'm in your speaker with the voice that you're lovin'

verse two guru

peace to the young ladies who wanna bone me much
and peace to my nigga premier with the golden touch
i never fall off point like deniro in casino
peace to black gambinos and all my peoples
dig the steelo -- i'm fightin wars you know
as in the jihad most humble most merciful
that's because i be god i trog through fogs puffing logs
mc's muttering menial madness they get mobbed
scarred and barred and then banished from my fuckin' kingdom
you got a fly one bring one or else i come to fling some
exquisite exotic exciting type shit
enough to make the real heads wake up and get hype quick
i'm type slick known as the god universal
kick rhymes without rehearsal i cross the burnin sands
now i stand here with virtue of course i could hurt you
simply with my point of view and i knew
that many would come that's why i've chosen
to cut off pathways and there's no runways or doorways open
for the jokers who ain't focused
and all the fake mercenaries get buried by the tongue of terrifying fury
nothing's blurry fuck it i got no worries
hearts and minds shine bright light with insight
yeah sense my birthright to set up cyphers with power
cause mad shit ain't right like punks in the spotlight
who can't freestyle sometimes i make my peeps smile
by sayin' somethin' crazy wild
like some shit off my dome that be soundin
better than the next man's whole album",2

she knows what she wants she's bold so she flaunts
her hourglass jewels to mad clientele
rejected oh well she ain't goin' to no hotel
not the frantic freak type but if you speak right
you get to take her out and dig her out on a weeknight
weekends she wants to spend your ends
her shopping spree is colossal attitude semi-hostile
mack diva senorita no reefer no pizza just
shrimp and lobsters champagne and mobsters
suckin up the cream like a vac to a carpet
strictly black market now you're her next target
watch out cause yo she knows what she wants

she knows what she wants 2x
yo she knows what she wants
she knows what she wants and just how to get it

spotted her in the club with her crew nearby
her looks are a lullaby to pass us by she's too fly
never gunshy hair is blown dry
she craves a wiseguy to help her gain amplify
so when you say yo baby she ain't gotta say hi to ya
cause prior to this he put rocks on her neck and wrist
plus a fat joint on her finger
you best to have a batch of scratch and treats to bring her
and if you happen to luck up and get in
you'll find yourself another jealous trick-ass boyfriend
and furthermore the mink she's donning is stunning
blinding your senses dunn never put the two
before the one son

it's the lesson well learned

it's going down

scratched it's the lesson well learned

it's going down

she knows what she wants 2x
yo she knows what she wants
yeah she knows what she wants and just how to get it

never fall victim to a chicken you was stickin
even if you think the punanny might be finger-lickin'
never fall victim to a wicked woman's ways
why son? she's trying to get paid check it
one she said she wanted to give me a son
two she said she didn't like my crew
three she never ever cooked for me
four she was my cheri amore -- yeah right
it was all hype i needed more insight
in retrospect i know i slept from the first night
she did a split and that was it
gave up my pimp license and flipped my whole friggin script
but now i'm back like the isley's moving wisely
sizing up the situation keeping honies waiting
'cause i got more to do than to be sucked dry
this tough guy will get by while the chickens wonder why
i don't be callin 'cause it's like ex to next kid
i know what i want and just how to get it

when i cock back these lyrics y'all punks best be ghost
i be the seven twenty-one eighteen twenty-one
the illest one i'm almost doper than anyone
straight out the late nights of bed-stuy
steppin up y'all put your weapons up i make heads fly
you're artificial like saccarhin
you're crazy fake it's more than skills you be lackin in
concepts you bite cause your identity ain't tight
tryin' to be somethin' you're not like pullin a knife at a gunfight
i'm troopin on night air like flight number 106
and gettin' all up in your fuckin' mix
you get me upset and i got you uptight
cause my committee's in your city tonight aight?
we got seventeen million of us plus two million indians
that makes 19 mil lightin shit up like wild bill
i be the supreme father plus the ill kid with drama
my karma creates the teflon to pierce your body armor
and make sure you check the shit before you walk to me or talk to me
steppin to me improperly you just may catch the weaponry
my specialty is tearin tracks out the frame
you know my fuckin' name i rule all game
i'm universal on all planes what's your claim?

yo i be your highness in slickness you chumps bear witness
tremendous tropper verbal nigga with he fitness
drop you for your spot with the blazer then i blast ya
slice precise like ?fenny hanas? when i come to bring the dramas
styles so swift that you can't peep the god
as your lyrics get buried six feet deep in my backyard
i laugh hard while your mental i run through mazes
dark stages of terror to shatter your dressing room mirror
your whole error gets crushed your whole show gets bumrushed
too many dumb punks want to enter this rap scene
kickin willie bobo but need to be slapped clean
into oblivion the true champion always rises
i bring surprises to the chief plus their advisers
size me up and you will find nothing's larger
catch more wreck on your dome than a deranged fuckin' barber
so what you made some dough you best keep on scramblin
all your vanity is instantly crushed when i start handlin
demandin that you pay for your weak rhyme display
coast to coast i break the fakes everyday

krumb snatcha
i see myself as the black rap messiah
colossal spreadin my gospel through electrical wires
spit fire through speech so i can reach each and every
tom dick and jerry slippin like petroleum jelly
too busy in the limelight can't rhyme tight
i got divine right to bring y'all to light
somethin' ain't right to be an mc you gotta thug
or to thug you gotta be an mc this shit is bugged
show love but few deal with crew and crew only
and think universal like sony
phony pounds and fake hugs is usually avoided
give a fuck like pizza hut i got to stay noyd-ed
cause that same nigga you trust could be that same cat
behind that gat that bust quiet ya with the silencer
keep it hush ashes to dust then dust to ashes
nowadays it's who pull out the fastest imagine this
rap shit without this gat shit or the phony cat
in black talkin' bout how much his mac spit
but this year gangstarr got changes bein made
no wack shit bein played no fake macks gettin' paid
no versace mc's with a mouth full of mo'
soundin like a hoe spittin' that old-fashioned show flow
i bombshell that pastel chanel rap through a maxwell
ever since young krumb was taught to rap well
goin' deep process of thought when my eyes closes
awaken with interpretive robe and sandals like moses
travellin high sands and eastern lands for the answers
ignorance is spreadin through the streets like it was cancer
too many drinkin' not thinkin' when behind that trigger

verse 1 guru

check the horror scene
the kid was like twelve or thirteen
never had the chance like other kids to follow dreams
watched his father catch two in the dome and to the spleen
nothin' but blood everywhere these streets are mean
they spared his life but killed his moms and his sister jean
of course over some drug shit
his pops was on some ill-out spill your guts on some thug shit
didn't know his boys was on some shady ass no love shit
his pops got played out though with silencers they laid him out yo
took his stash and all the cash and left 'em tied up on the couch yo
with tape over his mouth so he couldn't cry out
cause his dad was the nigga with clout
survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat who used to give him doe
and taught him to use the same gat
supposed to be an uncle fam and all that
he could tell it was him 'cause he wore the same slacks he wore when
he took him to meadowlands racetrack
why did he flip and go out like that?
it's called betrayal

verse 2 scarface

a betrayal
punk ass niggas
it's called betrayal

he on a mission to become a ball player
flip big benz's flossin all gators
had it all mapped out6-812th grader
fresh outta school he filn' to go lay paper
he had a brother who was hustlin collection his change
never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
and he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
so now he's pacin' as the time moves slowly
can't wait to face shaquille in the paint and school kobe
kept his grades and stayed up under neighborhood functions
and then a group of knuckleheads came through dumpin
so now he's sittin' on the sidewalk bleedin
fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin
and everybody in the neighborhood still grievin
but destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
and all the cryin in the world ain't goin' to bring him back
his brother sittin' at the wake wipin tears from his mother's eyes
why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
only the wicked live shife payin' the price
while he's starin' at the shell
his brothers soul wants hell the trigger man made bail
and you wouldn't pay the boys mail and sacrificed the fuckin' family

see he taught us to play almost every single day ok

with sha-rone he's bad to the bone boo's little sidekick
and a badass mouth he used to feist it on harmon street
with zach leo and ed
me jody and boop by june rocky and then comes
tommy and cedric lamont and greg unique in our own right
at times we'd fight but that's a-ight
still not realizin we had love it showed
when we played no phony charades against
one another now while i write this song
it's like some are still alive and a couple are gone

we're born to live a life to die
life's so damn short and i wonder why

as kids you're overlookin death
it didn't seem important or serious it just seems curious
it was about wakin' to a bowl of cereal
cartoons on saturday's karate flicks and like
ridin' your skateboard or bicycle
and went as deep as killa joe on the corner drinkin' ripple
plus puerto rican kids on the block were cool
we got along we all knew right from wrong
by far we got a dose that life was hard
a spanish we were close with was killed by a car
shocking alberto was hit on the block and
death was spontaneous his moms was clockin him 'cross the street
he just received an award
for little league baseball like an hour before plus
he didn't even get to see the summer set in
dyin' all young at the age of seven
it opened up my eyes small that the flesh was weak
as a kid thinkin' shit like that was mad deep peep it

now when somebody is gone that's when you realize how close you was
how close you are like a star
real deep it takes time to heal
and still from time to time you wish you could find the way to forgive
and let him know you forgave
but they can't feel six feet deep inside the grave
what's left but attend his wake believin if it was you
he'd do it for old time's sake damn
i'm disturbed by the news when i was told i was sittin'
knowin' damn well boo ain't bullshittin
my life flashed like big bills of cash
and good times we had now it's all so sad
one of my childhood pals hit the road
when you take to the streets then you die by the code
but in this case who knows what went down?
bottom line is wishin that he still was around
now he found a spot in my heart or should i say lobotomy
mike know you're trapped inside of me
and every other brother in bushwick
who rushed to your side thick all down with the click
yeah god bless he laid to rest
call him mike boogie that's what describes the nigga best

you lack the minerals and vitamins irons and the niacin
fuck who that i offend rappers sit back i'm bout to begin
bout foul talk you squawk never even walked the walk
more less destined to get tested never been arrested
my album will manifest many things that i saw did or heard about
or told first hand never word of mouth
what's in the future for the fusion in the changer?
rappers are in danger who will use wits to be a remainder
when the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
some will keep their limbs and some will be maimed
the same suckers with the gab about killer instincts
but turned bitch and knowin damn well they lack
in this division the connoisseur crackin your head with a 4 by 4
realize sucka i be the comin like noah
always sendin you down perpetratin facadin
what you consider a image to me this is just a scrimmage
i'm feel i'm stone not 'cause i bop or wear my cap cocked
the more emotion i put into it the harder i rock
those who pose lyrical but really ain't true i feel

[slick rick from the song hey young world]
their time's limited hard rocks too

speakin in tongues about what you did but you never done it
admit it you bit it cause the next man gained platinum behind it
i find it ironic so i researched and analyzed
most write about stuff they fantasized
i'm fed up with the bull on this focus of weed and clips
and glocks gettin cocked and wax not bein flipped
it's the same old same old just strain it from the anal
the contact is not com-pexed or vexed
so why you pushin it? why you lyin for? i know where you live
i know your folks you was a sucka as a kid
your persona's drama that you acquired in high school in actin class
your whole aura is plexi-glass
what's-her-face told me you shot this kid last week in the park
that's a lie you was in church with your moms
see i know yo slow your roll give a good to go
guys be lackin in this thing called rappin just for dough
of course we gotta pay rent so money connects but uh
i'd rather be broke and have a whole lotta respect
it's the principle of it i get a rush when i bust
some dope lines oral that maybe somebody'll quote
that's what i consider real in this field of music
instead of puttin brain cells to work they abuse it
non-conceptual non-exceptional
everybody's either crime-related or sexual
i'm here to make a difference besides all the riffin
the traps are not stickin rappers stop flippin
for those who pose lyrical but really ain't true i feel

i had to do a little bid
cause of the things i wanted
as a little kid
i wanted to be like the dealers a lot
cause of the things they had and the respect that they got
all the girls used to jock 'em
and i wondered why my parents used to knock 'em
i had a talent or a hobby you should say
i like rap or poetry but anyway
stay away from drugs
i paid it no mind
i wanted to hustle for bread
instead of writin rhymes
so i said to hell with it
instead of stayin away from drugs
i was sellin iti was out all day until the job was done
instead of rockin' the parties i was robbin 'em
the females paid me no mind not a giant
andre barnes at the time
but the rock started sellin the dough was comin' in
dealers wanted in girls started runnin' in
some said i'm crazy how i'm livini must be
crazy cash and crazy women
yeah my gear was right
they called me
andre the giant and it wasn't cause of my height
losin g's in celoi never sweat it
cause my connect got kilos
my bank two thou that's what's in it
rollin' celo headcrack makin' g's in a minute
oh yeah i'm all for dis
yeah i'm handsome
but the money made me gorgeous
now the girls wanna see me
the little kids around the block wanna be me
i was chillin' in thousand dollar coats
i had links and ropes and yo the shit was dope
i had the jewels oh did i have the jewels
the talk of the town the neighborhood news
but friends weren't true inside
they were passengers goin' along for the ride
and it makes you say damn
because i feel so hard
i had scars on my hands
i thought i'd be fine
but i got bagged and snagged and then i had to do a little time
friends don't hang it's a waste of timei got one dollar
one girl and some great rhymesi pursued the wrong dream
now to make a fast buck i gotta schemefind a celo game yo
bank i gotta buck
i ace to a deuce yeah that's just my luck
i gotta go right and exactinstead of a package
i wanted a mic and a hype trackinstead of robbin the parties
i'm rippin 'em
mc's were gettin' done every week a different one
it's time to put my talent to use
there's no excuse i just gotta get loose
and now i'm really convinced
i got raw with lord finesse
and been straight since
now you see how i lost it
but i bounced back
you might not be as fortunate
so take heed my friend
before you take a shortcut that leads to a dead end
take my advice cause the giant said so
and remember -- there's more than one way out the ghetto",2

verse one ag

livin' in the slums with the bums the rats and the stray cats
dogs with the rabies little babies are having babies
juveniles act wild
every footstep you take on every corner there's a crack vial
pushers dealers crackheads are buying
now the dealer's in jail all the crackheads are dying
my man got aids he was hit hard
to get laid he paid a crackhead for a five dollar quick job
in the ghettoes this stuff you have to find
a beer will relax my mind but i still pack my nine
'cause i'm aware of all evil and devilishment
because i'm living in a rat like settlement
sometimes it's hard to manage
i grab a forty take a sip and let the mental do the damage
yeah i'm woozy and my eyes are red
but it's better than a uzi and a brotherman is dead
see nine out of ten are black on black crimes
four out of nine were killed before their prime
the other five wanted vengeance
so now five out of five are doin' a jail sentence
ask the giant i've been through it
so when i reach to the top i say the ghetto made me do it
and i know how to strive huh
born and raised in the ghetto so you know i can survive

chorusrunaway runaway slave 8x in background

i gotta getaway i gotta do it now
or find a better way so how that sound both lines repeat 4x

verse two ag

chapter two of every black man's diary
drugs and diseases put in our society
kill another brother and it's bravery
come on that's one step backwards into mental slavery
yeah you best believe that's reality
you got black on black then there's police brutality
yeah it's bad but what makes it sad
is that i'm being harassed by a black man with a badge
he's sellin out because he's two-faced
but you only got one race you only got a nigga's face
he's sellin out because times is hard
and old ladies are gettin' robbed 'cause i can't find a job
fight to the top and the other man'll drop
and gettin' treated like savages will stop
you got the right plan but goin' about it the wrong way
divided is the long way united is the strong way
too many died for us to take a pause
so let's all get ours and stop tryin' to get yours
walk a straight path but it's so easy to stumble
so weak minds crumble in the concrete jungle
get your chance to sell drugs you don't pass up
but a fast buck will wind up to be your last buck
it's a damn shame you're deaf dumb and blind
did it ever cross your mind you're killin' off your own kind
and pretty soon even you will be a goner
easy access to guns liquor stores on every corner
street knowledge is a must you never learn enough
you're physically rough but mentally you gotta be tough
we shall overcome with no doubt
the runaway slave is sayin' peace and i'm out

i gotta getaway i gotta do it now
or find a better way so how that sound 2x",2
7,"ag
before becoming a runaway slave here's a taste of
mental slavery a backtrack

you don't catch hell because you're a methodist or a baptist
you don't catch hell because you're a democrat or republilcan
you don't catch hell because you're a mason or an elk
and you sure don't catch hell because you're an american
because if you were an american you wouldn't catch no hell
you don't catch hell because you're a black man

check it many try to come close
rest in peace to the deceased and the rest are comatose
i'm not a joke and i go for broke
and while i'm laughing you'll be gagging from the motherfucking gunsmoke
walk the streets and i play for keeps
and while i entertain suckers stay six feet deep
it was good while it lasted
broken bones and asses tombstones and caskets
i got fleeced i'm not strapped i'm a get you back
me saying mayday with an ak picture that
getting my props while you're propless
and if you try and escape we'll take grandma for hostage
i carry my joint
hoping to smoke a sucker just to keep on point
when dre's team goes to extremes call up an md
wetting a strip till my whole clip is empty
oh-ops and tecs ready to wreck the site
whoever's next to step is knifed in broad daylight
don't try to run you'll get blocked off
i got spotted by a cop so now that cop is knocked off
if i get back i get out with the quickness
the da the judge and the jury's on my hitlist
dressed in black with a hoodie and a low hat
what you did? spoke to the witness now the witness don't know jack
the giant and his crew are ill
we're sick-ass convicts we're hard to kill

my boys from new york is hard to kill
the brothers from jersey is hard to kill
i say out in philly is hard to kill
and the brothers in boston is hard to kill
to all my peeps in cali is hard to kill
don't forget about atlanta is hard to kill
to all my boys in connecticut is hard to kill
to my crew in texas is hard to kill

i'm around the way 141st and 3rd
40 bottles on the curb and my man got the bag of herb
another brother tried to get ill
and try to take me out on my block he forgot i was hard to kill
i ran for cover so the brother missed
he hit my man in the head now ed is dead yo what is this?
i won't stop until i see him rest
he got popped by the cops too late for the ems
ain't no chance for survival why's that?
he tried to go head on now he's dead on arrival
now you know i don't play around
cause the clown is face down and uptown is his burial ground
you want beef? well the more the merrier
and i'm a bury that man's clan in the same area
my entourage is fully strapped
turning your hard bodyguards to wussy and pussy cats
you know how we do it
putting the glock to the test go get your vest i'm going right through it
he survived in intensive care
did the impossible in the hospital knocked him off right there
i'm an expert at disposal
you see everyone goes on foes i'm killing hoes too
nobody takes the witness stand
your ass is out i'm cleaning niggas out like spic 'n' span
you want beef with a mastermind?
but it's fine pass the nine now it's disaster time
i love conflict and confrontation
killing enemies worse than kennedy's assassination
but that's not my style
i just got buckwild so i could prove i was versatile
styles go on and on
ag is all about peace speaking of peace now i'm gone

to the brothers in dc is hard to kill
and the brothers in va is hard to kill
down in north carolina is hard to kill
how about the brothers in maryland? is hard to kill",2
8,"showbiz
once again back again with my friends
diamond's beats are fat just like a benz
andre the giant is great but i should also mention
lord finesse he's the funky technician
i'm on my way to the studio it's the only way that i know
how to play down low
punching keys like rocky balboa
saying rest in peace to tshaka figeoroa
some got to grow up before they blow up
and did you ever know a young brother who had shit sewed up?
rented some bm's some volvos some benz
so much jewls i had to pass shit down to my friends
but when down and out and pockets are low
see how fast friends go when there's no cash flow
so i head for the top times are hard
pushing moms no pops i had to get my own props
i can wild out but instead
i just keep to myself and showbiz just hold his head

wally world just hold ya head
true dog just hold ya head
kerry dope just hold ya head
my cousin chris just hold ya head

ag
hold ya head that's what showbiz said
in memory of koto harris the eulogy read
another friend was laid to rest
this world is just chaos confusion and a big mess
but we got to keep striving
to leave town never stay down but keep rising
&gtfrom the ghetto not always ghetto minded
some is striving the finish line they never find it
all of the sudden they life stops
&gtfrom black on black to harassed by white cops
some went into jail to do time
they take away your time your freedom and your state of mind
so pay attention these are facts black
take it from the giant 'cause i've been there and back
this is advice so take it
stay strong on your path and you will make it
i'm not trying to tell you what to do
just hold ya head and everything else will follow through

to tyrell just hold ya head
to cool k just hold ya head
my brother kel just hold ya head
big todd just hold ya head

showbiz
green light that's go or should i stop?
i'm not trying to get bagged by any narc cops
what are you on dope or is this a joke?
is this the day you pull me over searching for cracks and coke?
what's the problem you know i'm sober
if you drove a fucking nova you wouldn't have to pull over
you're making me late my papers is straight
never hesitate to run a check and then let me skate
take my business card it's in my left hand
you got the right motherfucker but the wrong goddamn plan
so pass me by or you wonder why
niggas pull out their glock and point it right between your eye
but i got my shit together i never flip with the weather
and i always think clever
i think positive and legit
i gotta give big shouts to my peeps kendu and infinite
brothers stare into my face like i'm a sucker
it's too easy to kill another young motherfucker
so i ignore it i turn the other cheek
yo show you ain't got any time for these niggas these boys is weak
some punks want to spit razors shit for rocks
packing a glock and i don't shoot blanks
young boys that thought they was ready step to this
they made wrong moves because that ass got rocksteady
down the line far from kind
whip in behind and still packing nothing but a nine
back on the block or out on the streets
i recoup a dre's scheme real neat to make ends meet
but i can't live trife shot stabbed with a knife
i want kids and a wife not 25 to life
negative thoughts are dead
showbiz is the man that always hold his motherfucking head

to my man tone just hold ya head

the anticipation arose as time froze
i stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
into the deep cosmos
the impact pushed back the first five rows
but before the raw live shows
i remember i'se a little snot-nosed
rockin' gazelle goggles and izod clothes
learnin the ropes of ghetto survival
peepin out the situation i had to slide through
had to watch my back my front plus my sides too
when it came to gettin' mine i ain't tryin' to argue
sometimes i wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you
hip-hop you the love of my life and that's true
when i was handlin the shit i had to do
it was all for you from the door for you
speak through you gettin' paper on tour for you
from the start thought was down by law for you

we ripped shit and kept it hardcore for you

how she was desperately seekin' to organize in a konfusion
usin' no protection told her on _resurrection_
caught in the hype williams and lost her direction
gettin' eight/ate in sections where i wouldn't eat her
an under the counter love so _silent_-ly i _treat_ her
her daddy'll beat her eyes all puff-ed
in the mix on tape niggaz had her in the buff
when we touch it was more than just a fuck
the police in her i found peace like who?
like malcolm in the east
seen her on the streets of new york trickin off
tried to make a hit with her but my dick went soft
movin weight losin weight not picky - with who she choose to date
to confuse the hate with her struggle i relate
close to thirty most of the niggaz she know is dirty
havin' more babies than lauryn she started showin early
as of late i realized that this is her fate
or destiny that brings the best of me
it's like god is testin me
in _retrospect_ i see she brought _life_ and death to me
peace to us collectively live and direct when we perform
it's just coffee shop chicks and white dudes
over her i got into it with that nigga ice cube
now the fight moved to in life makin' the right moves
besides god and family you my life's jewel

says she's workin' on a flick and could my click do the score
she says she loved my show at paris at elys'e montmartre

we knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
she like that shit don't matter when i get home get at her

that people bite back and fracture what's intact

i deal with the real so if it's artificial let it be

muffled sound of fist on flesh
blows to chest
no breath
air gasps
you ain't nothing but white trash bitch
with each hit each kick each broken rib
crack crack
bones are crying
mommy's crying and bleeding
and pleading
and then
daddy wants to fuck
dick hard swelled with power rush
and as if all that wasn't enough
mommy's seven months heavy with birth
as daddy grunts and cursed drunk nothings in her bloodied ear

singing softly
first lullaby
first son will ever hear
and never forget

mommy almost bled to death when she have him finally
she'd already lost three
uterus-bruised shredded and weak
&gtfrom being daily beat
and friday nights were the worse and
daddy never came with flowers
instead he spent hours at some corner spot
with some bar pop named cookie
putting his thing down
soiling mommy's sheets with
sweet talk shit
cookie's cheap lipstick
hair grease sperm and jezebel juice

to hell with the good news that
he was a father for the first time
his thirst for wine and women
clouded his vision
no warm welcome for mother and son
just
the rank smell of ass-crack funk and cum
but mommy's prayerful strength-her best defense
she burned the dirty linens
made a fresh bed
laid sleeping first son down
and never made a sound
as she purged her scourge
with birth-blood and quiet tears
watching as her fears and love and sacrifice
lie there in his soft skin and new life
breathing dreaming fresh from god's eye
mommy's little survivor
like her

mommy called crazy and scorned
'cause she two more born
one boy soon after
the girl much later and
although they were both sung the same lullabies of hate
her first son the first one
whose womb-world was profaned
came of age playing street games
with stewie rezzie and little brother
till his heart start to wither
in pain and shame
blamed mom for the wrong she let daddy do to her
and him
let sins of the father cause his innocence to wander
found out amongst thieves
chose to squander his dreams
stopped believing in himself
become prodigal with his life
make impossible shit right with
gang-ties crime lies
erase wise woeful words of mother
replaced them with absurdities of others
who had also lost their way

played a different kind of street game now
first son plunged deep
speak street-family vows
espouse no causes but his own
see he couldn't protect mommy's neck from daddy's grasp
or protect mommy's ass from daddy's wrath
couldn't shield her ears from
daddy's foul-mouthed liquor-breath jeers
his only defense-served be confidence
brown bottles housed his swift descent
phones called cops on block frequent for his shenanigans
now daddy and him twins in addiction
driven to false-hearted heavens and friends
by liquefied demons
had become what he despised from conception till end
destined for a demise
survived nine lives of staying high
conning jewelry-pawning arrests theft
womanizing only for money never for sex
bullet in chest baseball bat to the head
left for dead
so eyes wide and glassy
speech slowed and slurred
lips twitched with caked-up codeine candy
and mouth corners one december 24th
mr hide and false friend
took final ride to suburban supplier
shots were fired by the gray man
with shaky hand
but not shaky enough to miss
hit lost boy in back
so-called friend runs for door
leaves first son blood-born
lying alone in blood on cold floor

death was the cost of
returning to innocence lost

baby 'sis awake for dawn on christmas morn
to mommy's sobs and shakes
daddy's silhouettes of regret
all past omitted and absolved by lost
as they clung to each other

slipped out my underoos sat on the toilet bowl
and let the hand i hold the mike with
take control

cause that would blow me round the world in a day
we drove into the drive-in and she didn't have to pay
because we dressed her up to look just like a chevrolet

naked on a mountain top tootin on a flizoot
ridin' on a horse drinkin' whisky out a bizoot

aight bro
cause there are otha fish

slim kid tre
it took a second to register up in my branium
my dome my head my skull my cranium
my eyes have had enough it was time to do some talkin'
i had to creep through the hound-dogs that were stalkin
this slimmy caught me peepin this means she wasn't sleepin'
on who i was so she crept in like a hawk
in a minutes time we adjourned to the floor
ooh i hit a high note cause of the way that she was walkin'
we got into the groove i didn't bust no uh hip-hop moves
i just kept it nice and smooth
next thing you know we got together word i thought wed be forever
didn't have an um-ber-ella now i'm soaked in stormy weather
whether two birds of a feather fly or fall it'll be together
never sympin and leave your love life limp
therell be no suicide attempts for this slim-trim kid
'cause you know there's otha fish in the sea that is in the sea
in the sea that is

in the sea you know there's otha fish in the sea that is

i reminisce try to clear up all the myths
for an imaginary kiss with you again
not even friends though i wish that i could mend
like a tailor and be olive oyls number one sailor
i ams what i am still i falls like an anvil
she's heavy on the mind sometimes its more than i can handle
but men aren't supposed to tumble into the den b
macho but i hancho like pancho will give in
family oriented but not oriental
a dame is supposed to claim ya even if you drive a pinto
a hero is a sandwich and a manwich is a meal
a marriage is a paper are they fakin or for real?
what's the deal dabbers? will you go tumbling after
your man and take a stand or will you help him roll faster?
the reason why i ask you is because i'm sick of this
bitch lickin' drip drip from a niggaz benefits
he doesn't even suit ya and hes surely not ya size
i'm surprised that you slept on a heart that's worldwide
and when ya open up ya eyes babe my mate i really wish
that ya don't bruise a limb as ya swim with otha fish in the sea
in the sea that is

now if there ain't no mountain high enough
why ain't you climbin up?
my hand has been extended every since the day i lent it to ya
i thought i knew ya but i didn't even know ya
bro you're stupid cause ya thought you'd catch a cupid
and you found that love ain't two wiffs of shit
so i resign or quit
it ain't even about the hips or the lips or the tits or
even the pussywhip elizabeth this is it
because i slipped and i tripped into a shoe that didn't fit
and now the next man is stealing my heart away
id charge him like a bull but his pull never fades me
the kid is going crazy they steppin with my lady
they workin on a baby i'm pushin up the daisies but
hey diddle diddle i won't play second fiddle
to no man and stand firm on this
and seal up on the bliss with a big juicy kiss
just call me big gibraltor miss

i look in every hip-hop magazine
it seems
that the blunts are being passed around the scenes in teams
and the common man with contraband in lesser amounts
i guess 'cause understands he has his chance to pass it like fouts
but his pass is incomplete 'cause i can tell in the smell
to let the dutchie pass me by
to the left catch hell
if i wanted to smoke tobacco i'd get a skinny white bitch
i know that fatlip carries a pack to cure the nicotine itch
because the only itch i have is for the indoe or sens
so don't pass me that mess
or try to even protest
that it's adding to the flavor 'cause the old one was fine
won't you pack the pipe
and keep it movin' down the line

the pipe the pipe
let's pack the pipe
x4

i got a big ol' blunt
i'm lampin' on my front porch
about to put a torch to it
then coco said don't do it
please don't hit that shit in front of my little four year old son
she sent him inside the house meanwhile my sheri steadily rolled one
what are you doing daddy?
after the other
then another
'cause i'm rollin' in the dough
so we rolled in the indoe
as if the kid didn't know
he's lookin' through the windoew yo while we tryin' to hide it
to make a boy grow to be ignorant and misguided
about the bud
now i have to play the part of the advisor
because the bud is just the tasty tantalizer
the bud not the beer 'cause the bud makes me wiser
figaro
so i said come're little man
whatcha want old man
and with his little hand
he grabbed the pipe
a lesson in buddah blessin'
not too young
just right
so he started blazin'
it was amazin'
my lungs are black and shriveled up like a raisin
but who am i to deny the kid a try
at nature's little way of sayin' hi?
thank you old man
so pack

they sing the same old song
about how they walls always the cleanest

wall telling you that commissary is low
race wars happening no calling co
no calling your mother to save you
homies to say you're reputable not acceptable
your behavior is sammy the bull-like
a killer that turned snitch
walls is telling me you a bitch
you pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
that sentence so important
walls telling you to listen to sing about me
retaliation is strong you even dream 'bout me
killed my homeboy and god spared your life
dumb criminal got indicted same night
so when you play this song rewind the first verse
about me abusing my power so you can hurt
about me and her in the shower whenever she horny
about me and her in the after hours of the morning
about her baby daddy currently serving life

until i realized i didn't know shit the day i came home

we been waitin' for you waitin' for you
waitin' for you waitin' for you

i met a little boy that resembled my features
nappy afro gap in his smile hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd
run a number on man and woman that crossed him
sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted
tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
he looked at me and said kendrick you do know my language
you just forgot because of what public schools had painted
oh i forgot don't kill my vibe that's right you're famous
i used to watch on channel 5 tv was taken
but never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it
it's just a new trip take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
make a new list of everything you thought was progress
and that was bullshit i mean your life is full of turmoil
spoiled by fantasies of who you are i feel bad for you
i can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
if you resist i'll back off quick go catch a flight or two
but if you pick destiny over rest in peace then be an advocate
tell your homies especially to come back home

this is a world premiere
this is a world premiere

everybody want to talk about who this and who that
who the realest and who wack or who white or who black
critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin'
motherfucker if you did then killer mike'd be platinum
y'all priorities fucked up put energy in wrong shit
hennessy and crown vic my memory been gone since
don't ask me 'bout no camera blocking at award shows
no don't ask about my bitch no don't ask about my foes
'less you askin' me about power yeah i got a lot of it
i'm the only nigga next to snoop that can push the button
had the coast on standby
k dot what up? i heard they opened up pandora's box
i box 'em all in by a landslide
nah homie we too sensitive it spill out to the streets
i make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
but i resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with jay
he said it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game

i been a-1 since day one you niggas boo boo

i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in a hotel room
i didn't want to self-destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
but that didn't stop survivors guilt
going back and forth
trying to convince myself the stripes i earned
or maybe how a-1 my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting
a continuous war back in the city
i was entering a new one",3
10,"how much a dollar really cost?
the question is detrimental paralyzin' my thoughts
parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling y'all
gotta see how i'm chillin' once i park this luxury car
hopping out feeling big as mutombo
twenty on pump six dirty marcellus called me dumbo
twenty years ago can't forget now i can lend all my ear or two
how to stack these residuals tenfold the liberal concept of what men'll do
twenty on six he didn't hear me
indigenous african only spoke zulu my american tongue was slurry
walked out the gas station a homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
asked me for ten 'rand stressin' about dry land
deep water powder blue skies that crack open
a piece of crack that he wanted i knew he was smokin' he begged and pleaded
asked me to feed him twice i didn't believe it told him beat it
contributin' money just for his pipe i couldn't see it
he said my son temptation is one thing that i've defeated
listen to me i want a single bill from you nothin' less nothin' more
i told him i ain't have it and closed my door tell me how much a dollar cost

it's more to feed your mind
water sun and love the one you love
all you need the air you breathe

he's starin' at me in disbelief
my temper is buildin' he's starin' at me i grab my key
he's starin' at me i started the car then i tried to leave
and somethin' told me to keep it in park until i could see
the reason why he was mad at a stranger like i was supposed to save him
like i'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
he's starin' at me his eyes followed me with no laser
he's starin' at me i notice that his stare is contagious
'cause now i'm starin' back at him feelin' some type of disrespect
if i could throw a bat at him it'd be aimin' at his neck
i never understood someone beggin' for goods
askin' for handouts takin' it if they could
and this particular person just had it down pat
starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
have you ever opened up exodus 14?
a humble man is all that we ever need tell me how much a dollar cost

it's more to feed your mind
water sun and love the one you love
all you need the air you breathe

guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
i never met a transient that demanded attention
they got me frustrated indecisive and power trippin'
sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
i should distance myself i should keep it relentless
my selfishness is what got me here who the fuck i'm kiddin'?
so i'mma tell you like i told the last bum
crumbs and pennies i need all of mines
and i recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
i got better judgement i know when nigga's hustlin' keep in mind
when i was strugglin' i did compromise now i comprehend
i smell grandpa's old medicine reekin' from your skin
moonshine and gin nigga you're babblin' your words ain't flatterin'
i'm imaginin' denzel but lookin' at o'neal
kazaam is sad thrills your gimmick is mediocre
the jig is up i seen you from a mile away losin' focus
and i'm insensitive and i lack empathy
he looked at me and said your potential is bittersweet
i looked at him and said every nickel is mines to keep
he looked at me and said know the truth it'll set you free
you're lookin' at the messiah the son of jehovah the higher power
the choir that spoke the word the holy spirit
the nerve of nazareth and i'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
the price of having a spot in heaven embrace your loss i am god

i wash my hands i said my grace what more do you want from me?
tears of a clown guess i'm not all what is meant to be
shades of grey will never change if i condone
turn this page help me change so right my wrongs",3

twelve years of age thinkin' my shade too dark
i love myself i no longer need cupid
enforcin' my dark side like a young george lucas
light don't mean you smart bein' dark don't make you stupid
and frame of mind for them bustas ain't talkin' woohah
need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored

and sometimes i get off watching you die in vain
it's such a shame they may call me crazy
they may say i suffer from schizophrenia or something but homie you made me
black don't crack my nigga

i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this witnesses will convey just what i mean
been feeling this way since i was sixteen came to my senses
you never liked us anyway fuck your friendship i meant it
i'm african american i'm african
i'm black as the moon heritage of a small village pardon my residence
came from the bottom of mankind
my hair is nappy my dick is big my nose is round and wide
you hate me don't you
you hate my people your plan is to terminate my culture
you're fucking evil i want you to recognize that i'm a proud monkey
you vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
and this is more than confession
i mean i might press the button just so you know my discretion
i'm guarding my feelings i know that you feel it
you sabotage my community making a killing
you made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga

the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry the bigger i shoot

i said they treat me like a slave cah' me black
woi we feel a whole heap of pain cah' we black
and man a say they put me in a chain cah' we black
imagine now me gold chain full of rocks
how you no see the whip left scars 'pon me back
but now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
all them say we doomed from the start cah' we black
remember this every race start from the black just remember that

i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this witnesses will convey just what i mean
i mean it's evident that i'm irrelevant to society
that's what you're telling me penitentiary would only hire me
curse me till i'm dead
church me with your fake prophesizing that i'mma be another slave in my head
institutionalize manipulation and lies
reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
you hate me don't you
i know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
jealous of my wisdom and cards i dealt
watching me as i pull up fill up my tank then peel out
muscle cars like pull ups show you what these big wheels 'bout ah
black and successful this black man meant to be special
cat scans on my radar bitch how can i help you
how can i tell you i'm making a killing
you made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga

the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice

i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
when i finish this if you listen i'm sure you will agree
this plot is bigger than me it's generational hatred
it's genocism it's grimy little justification
i'm african american i'm african
i'm black as the heart of a fucking aryan
i'm black as the name of tyrone and darius
excuse my french but fuck you no fuck y'all
that's as blunt as it gets
i know you hate me don't you
you hate my people i can tell 'cause it's threats when i see you
i can tell cause your ways deceitful
know i can tell because you're in love with the desert eagle
thinking maliciously he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
it's funny how zulu and xhosa might go to war
two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
remind me of these compton crip gangs that live next door
beefing with pirus only death settle the score
so don't matter how much i say i like to preach with the panthers
or tell georgia state marcus garvey got all the answers
or try to celebrate february like it's my b-day
or eat watermelon chicken and kool-aid on weekdays
or jump high enough to get michael jordan endorsements
or watch bet cause urban support is important
so why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street
when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me

the ghost of mandela hope my flows they propel it
let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and if you riding with me nigga let me ask this question nigga

i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in the hotel room
i didn't wanna self destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
but that didn't stop survivor's guilt
going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned
or maybe how a-1 my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city i was entering a new one
a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned
the word was respect
just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
doesn't mean i can't respect you as a black man
forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
but i don't know
i'm no mortal man
maybe i'm just another nigga

shit and that's all i wrote
i was gonna call it another nigga but it ain't really a poem i just felt like it's something you probably could relate to
other than that now that i finally got a chance to holler at you i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-
about a metaphor actually uh you spoke on the ground
what you mean 'bout that what the ground represent?

tupac shakur and kendrick lamar
the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil right
that's how i see it my word is bond
i see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people right the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people
'cause the rich people gonna be so fat they gonna be so appetizing you know what i'm saying?
wealthy appetizing the poor gonna be so poor and hungry you know what i'm saying?
it's gonna be like you know what i'm saying?
it's gonna be like there might be some cannibalism out this mother they might eat the rich

aight so let me ask you this then
do you see yourself as somebody that's rich or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?
i see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of the word
i took nothin' i took the opportunities i worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it
i went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company
i changed everything i realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what i'm saying?
i made myself a millionaire
i made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions for myself you know what i'm saying?
i made millions for the record companies i made millions for these movie companies now i make millions for for us

and through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
by my faith in god by my faith in the game and by my faith in all good all good things come to those that stay true you know what i'm saying?
and it was happening to me for a reason you know what i'm saying?
i was noticing shit i was punching the right buttons and it was happening
so it's no problem you know i mean it's a problem but i'm not finna let them know i'm finna go straight through

would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that heh somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
shit i like to think that at every opportunity i've ever been uh threatened with resistance it's been met with resistance
and not only me but it goes down my family tree you know what i'm saying?
it's in my veins to fight back

aight well how long you think it take before niggas be like we fighting a war i'm fighting a war i can't win and i wanna lay it all down
in this country a black man only have like five years we can exhibit maximum strength and that's right now while you a teenager while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back
'cause once you turn thirty it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man in this country and you don't wanna fight no more
and if you don't believe me you can look around you don't see no loud mouth thirty-year old motherfuckers

that's crazy because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?
i think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be like uh bloodshed for real
i don't think america know that
i think american think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing
it's gonna be murder you know what i'm saying?
it's gonna be like nat turner 1831 up in this motherfucker
you know what i'm saying? it's gonna happen

kendrick lamar and tupac shakur
that's crazy man
in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lotta people don't understand how important it is
sometimes i be like get behind a mic and i don't know what type of energy i'mma push out or where it comes from
trip me out sometimes
because the spirits we ain't even really rappin' we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us

kendrick lamar
damn
i wanted to read one last thing to you
it's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world
it says

the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city
while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly
the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar
but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
he can no longer see past his own thoughts he's trapped
when trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
the result?
wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle
although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the same

what's your perspective on that?
pac? pac? pac",3

and everything a nigga do may not be what he might say
chicago nights stay stay on the mind
but i write many lives and lay on these lines
wave the signs of the times
many say the grind's on the mind
shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wonderin' where i'm

waiting for the lord to rise

the chosen one from the land of the frozen sun

how beautiful love can be
on the streets love is hard to see
gotta reach that frequency
loving you is loving me

1st verse
yeah you know what love is
even found it on the ground where the thugs live
my man had to dig deep to find his
couldn't sleep cause on the real he had 5 kids
live nigs real niccas express and chase it
in crap games black dames and big faces
cases in court fam showing loving support
you and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
as men we were taught to hold it in
that's why we don't know how till we older men
if love is a place ima go again
at least now now i know to go within
at times it can take ya for a spin
heartbreak hotel then you're home again
i seen love make a nicca soul pretend
like a story that he don't want to end

2nd verse
it's all love where we come from
in the hood loved we was told to run from
that same hood where the gun sung
we holla love hoping it become one
crack got so many lives undone
from lack of love many hide some run
i knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
demonstration with a man had her trapped in a maze
tryin' to find herself to regain much of that she had gave
love can free us to which some react as a slave
funny we love 'em more when they relaxed in a grave
wonder if a thug is raw or is he acting afraid?
everybody loves somebody but i attract shade
heard of the love of money but compassionate pays
talk about it with my youth so she understand
what it is to be loved by a man unnh

3rd verse
some say that i'm a dreamer 'cause i talk about it often
seen the hardest niccas soften with his homie in a coffin
we walk in stand and fall in it
with the right companion we all in it

having broad limits in the game of life

they had no code of ethics

what's the matter a guy was only tryin' to have fun
get to work on these boys anybody bring a gun for me?
yeah here's one

not one but two typical villain releases included
i know they wanna kiss me but don't let anyone see me like that please doctor help me
and a sequel
master of all
both the villains were to meet in
your mother was the lightning

two historical figures outlaws and desperadoes if that the villainous pair of really nice boys who just happened to be on the wrong side of the law
three hundred and sixty degrees
similar sequences could not be defeated
villains who possess supernatural abilities
villains who were the personification of carnage
madvillain more accurately the dark side of our beings
perhaps it is due to this seminal connection that audiences can relate their experience in life with the villains and their dastardly doings",3

or even one with two blades on it
hey you don't touch the mic like it's aids on it ya

yesterday belongs to the dead because the dead belongs to the past

today is the preview of tomorrow but for me
only from a better and happier point of view

i'm tired and ran away i should ask a choir
what do you require to sing a song that acquire me to have faith

you had finally made decision to hold me against my will
it was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
i can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
every time you clock in the morning i feel you just want to kill
all my innocence while ignoring my purpose to persevere as a better person
i know you heard this and probably in fear
but what am i supposed to do with the blinking of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
and you ask lift up your shirt 'cause you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile

to stage a robbery the third saturday i clocked in
projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
cocaine laced in marijuana
and they wonder why i rarely smoke now
imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
i was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even

and it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of being a lawyer or doctor instead of boy with a chopper
that hold the cul-de-sac hostage kill 'em all if they gossip
the children of the corn they vandalizing
the option of living a lie drown their body with toxins
constantly drinking and drive hit the powder then watch this flame

i woke up this morning and figured i'd call you
in case i'm not here tomorrow i'm hoping that i can borrow
a peace of mind i'm behind on what's really important
my mind is really distorted i find nothing but trouble in my life
i'm fortunate you believe in a dream
this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
and last night was just another distraction or a reaction
of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened
you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was all right and a fight he tried to put up
but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
as blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive
everybody's a victim in my eyes
when i ride it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
a demon glued to my back whispering get 'em
i got 'em and i ain't give a fuck
that same mentality that told my brother not to duck
in actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
i wonder if i'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
the life that i knew as a young'n in pajamas and dun-ta-duns
when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
dumb niggas like me never prosper
prognosis of a problem child i'm proud and well devoted
this piru shit been in me forever
so forever i'mma push it wherever whenever

just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big

my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

you wrote a song about my sister on your tape
and called it section80 the message resembled brenda's got a baby
what's crazy was i was hearin about it
but doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
judging her past and shit well it's completely my future
her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
and i'mma need that 40 dollars even if i gotta
fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot
gonzales park i'm followed by a married man a father of three
my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keys
matter of fact he my favorite 'cause he tip me with e's
he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week
this is the life of another girl damaged by the system
these foster homes i run away and never do miss 'em
see my hormones just run away and if i can get 'em back
to where they used to be then i'll probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin'
then you probably need to beat her that's how i was taught
three niggas in one room first time i was tossed
and i'm exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit
my sister died in vain but what point are you trying to gain
if you can't fit the pumps i walk in?
i'll wait
your rebuttal a little too late
and if you have a album date just make sure i'm not in the song
'cause i don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great?
a doctor's approval is a waste of time i know i'm straight
i'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
i'll never fade away i'll never fade away i know my fate
and i'm on the grind for this cake i'mma get it or die trying
i'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
you lying to these motherfuckers talking about you can help 'em
with my story you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga
don't ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga

sometimes i look in a mirror and ask myself
am i really scared of passing away? if it's today i hope i hear a
cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
with the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of jesus
i wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
reeking the scent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon and if i'm doomed
may the wound help my mother be blessed for many moons
i suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror
get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots
and i'm not sure why i'm infatuated with death
my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
maybe 'cause i'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when i'mma rest
and you're right your brother was a brother to me
and your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak of something that's realer than the tv screen
by any means wasn't trying to offend or come between
her personal life i was like it need to be told
cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul
exactly what'd happen if i ain't continued rappin'
or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
fives i count lives all on these songs
look at the weak and cry pray one day you'll be strong
fighting for your rights even when you're wrong
and hope that at least one of you sing about me when i'm gone
am i worth it? did i put enough work in?

promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off
and it's my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

promise that you'll sing about me forever
promise that you'll sing about me for ooh
promise that you'll sing about me forever
promise that you'll sing about me for ooh
promise that you'll sing about me forever
promise that you'll sing about me for ooh

dreams of balling like spalding but only shotty bounce
the reaper calling i'm cottonmouth
money is power money is power yours is ours yours is ours
lay with a snitch die with a coward
hope we get rich hope we can tower
over the city with vanity with the music louder
the same song a black flower
i'll show you how to
dye your thirst dye your thirst dye your thirst

what are we doing? who are we fooling?
hell is hot fire is proven
to burn for eternity return of the student
that never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it

'cause we have the same eyes can't you tell?
the days i tried to cover up and conceal
my pride it only made it harder for me to deal

and plan c just an excuse like because
or the word but but what if i got love?
i love them i love when i love her
i love so much i love when love hurts
i love first verse 'cause you're the girl i attract
i love second verse 'cause you're the homie that pack
burner like a stove top that love cooking from scratch
i love what the both of you have to offer
in fact i love it so much i don't love anything else
but what love got to do with it when i don't love myself
to the point i should hate everything i do love?
should i hate living my life inside the club?
should i hate her for watching me for that reason?
should i hate him for telling me that i'm seizin'?
should i hate them for telling me ball out?
should i hate street credibility i'm talkin' about
hating all money power respect in my will
or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

well easy come easy go how that saying goes
no more broad service cars and them tv shows
i had all that snatched from me a&amprs and they faculties
all turn their back on me and didn't want to hear a rap from me
so naturally actually had to face things factually
had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me
'cause nothing's there nothing's fair
i don't want to ever go back there
so i won't be taking no days off till my spaceship takes off

we are all here for a reason on a particular path
you don't need a curriculum to know that you are a part of the math
cats think i'm delirious but i'm so damn serious
that's why i expose my soul to the globe the world
i'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
i'm not just another individual
my spirit is a part of this that's why i get spiritual
but i get my hymns from him
so it's not me it's he that's lyrical
i'm not a miracle i'm a heaven sent instrument
my rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
for your soul and your mental
that's why i'm instrumental vibrations is what i'm into
yeah i need my loot by rent day
but that ain't what gives me the heart of kunta kinte
i'm trying to get us us free like cinque
i can't stop that's why i'm hot
determination dedication motivation
i'm talking to you of my many inspirations
when i say i can't let you or self down
if i were on the highest cliff on the highest riff
and if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
in my grip i would never ever let you down
and when these words are found
let it be known that god's penmanship has been signed
with a language called love
that's why my breath is felt by the deaf
and while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
i too dream in color and in rhyme
so i guess i'm one of a kind in a full house
'cause whenever i open my heart my soul or my mouth
a touch of god reigns out take'em to the church

they plan was to knock me out the top of the game
but i overstand they truth is all lame
i hold cannons that shoot balls of flames
right in they fat mouth then i carve my name
nas - too real nas - true king
it's however you feel g'head you swing
your arms too short to box with god
i don't kill soloists only kill squads
fame went to they head so now it's fuck nas
yesterday you begged for a deal today you tough guys
i seen it comin'
soon as i popped my first bottle i spotted my enemies tryna' do what i do
came in with my style so i fathered you
i kept changin on the world since barbeque
now you wanna hang with niggas i hung with
fuck bitches i hit it's funny i once said
if i ever make a record
i take a check and put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
but look at me now ten years deep
since in the project crack in my socks weep
i never asked to be top of rap's elite
just a ghetto child tryna' learn the traps of the streets
but look at me now

you're the man you're the man
you're the man you're the man
you're the man you're the man
you're the man you're the man
you're the man you're the man

now wait a sec' give me time to explain women and fast cars
and diamond rings can poison a rap star
it's suicidal how i smoke in so much la'
i saw a dead bird flyin through a broken sky
wish i could flap wings and fly away
to where black kings and ghana stay
so i could get on my flesh right away
but that'll be the day when it's peace
when my gat don't need to spray
when these streets are safe to play
sex with death indulge in these women
vision my own skeleton swimmin in eternal fire
broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
like the exorcist then they gave birth to my seeds
i beg for god's help why they love hurtin' me?
i'm your disciple a thug certainly
i'm the n the a to the s-i-r
if i wasn't i must've been escobar
forty-five in my waist starin' at my reflection
in the mirror sittin' still in the chair like my conception
when everything around me got cloudy the chair became a king's throne
my destiny found me
it's clear why the struggle was so painful
metamorphosis this is what i changed to
and god i'm so thankful

chorus to fade",3
5,"listen up gangstas and honeys with ya hair done

the bullet goes back in the gun
the bullet hole's closin this chest of a nigga
now he back to square one
screamin shoot don't please
i put my fifth back on my hip

my caravan doors open up
i jumped back in the van and closed it shut
goin' reverse slowly prepared
my nigga jungle utters out somethin' crazy like go he there
sittin' in back of this chair we hittin the roach
the smoke goes back in the blunt the blunt gets bigger in growth
jungle unrolls it put his weed back in the jar
the blunt turns back into a cigar
we listen to stevie it sounded like heavy metal fans
spinnin records backwards of ac/dc
i give my niggas dap jump out the van back first
back upstairs took off the black shirt
i'm in the crib with the phone to my ear

so with my mouth wide holdin' my heat
bullets i had plenty to squeeze plenty for ya
'cause jungle said block your on enemies the
hung up the phone then the phone rang
i'm laid in the bed thinkin' 'bout this pretty young thing
who left she came back her clothes just fell to the rug
she fell to my bed and gave me a hug
i told her no hell
she talkin' 'bout me kiss
bobbed her head then spit the nut back in my dick
started suckin with no hands a whole lotta spit
then got up and put her bra back on her tits
got fully dressed and told me stressed really i'm
picked up her gucci bag and left her nigga behind
walkin' through the door she rang the bell twice
i vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
the clock went back from three to two to one
and that's about the time the story begun
that's when i first heard the voicemail on the cell
it said son we found that nigga we gotta kill

saw divine goon and chungo lil' turkey
rip tyrone 'member no cursin front of ms vercey

junior high school dropout teachers never cared
they was paid just to show up and leave no one succeeds
so he moves with his peers different blocks different years
sittin' on different benches like it's musical chairs
all his peoples moved on in life he's on the corners at night
with young dudes it's them he wanna be like
it's sad but it's fun to him right? he never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up he's in his second childhood

yo yo life they wonder 
can they take me under? nah never that
yo yo i come from the housing tenement buildings
unlimited killings menaces marked for death
better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
though i owe to it my success
well survival of the fittest every day as a child
i would think i'm a part of usa and be proud
confronted with racism started to feel foreign
like the darker you are the realer your problems
i reached for the stars but i just kept slipping
on this life mission never know what's next
ain't your king from fiji welcome julius caesar
had a piece of the globe every continent
there was asia africa europe france japan
pakistan america afghanistan
yo there was protestants jews blacks arabics
call a truce world peace stop acting like savages
no war we should take time and think
the bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
cut since the beginning of time it's been man with arms fighting
lost lives in the towers and pentagons
why then must it on we must stop the killing
tell me why we die we all god's children

all this hate can't last forever
it's time that we stand together
everybody wants to rule the world

come on world world world
peace world world world
peace world world world
peace world world world

all those brothers on the block posted up like they own it
that's daytona from new york to california
got blocks locked down
like dog you safe whenever you with me
see this is my town
so the youngstas pros and ghettos goes to prison
at a early age already know it's against them
so in order for him to survive one day
he must open up his eyes to the set backs
'cause everybody wants a shot in this land of opportunity
look at what this country's got
there shouldn't be nobody homeless
how can the president fix all the problems when he ain't fixed home yet
the earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
to all colors and creeds is to whom it belongs
i want land mansions banks and gold
the diamonds in africa oil in my control
the world's natural resources own its residuals
but then comes foes i have to guard it with missiles
and i become the most wanted
but is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by secret service
i guess attempts at my life are loaded barrels
so move over colin powell just throw in a towel yo

all this hate can't last forever
it's time that we stand together
everybody wants to rule the world

come on world world world
peace world world world

y'all know that's my style and hit you at the right time
no other compares to what nas write down
tell you my dreams show you my pain is yours
you could get what you love be a chain to cause
you alive right now
there's so many that dead or locked up inside the beast
i'ma holler it now
it's whatever man think'll manifest to be real
the plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals
all this hate can't forever last
all my ghetto heroes in heaven it's like you right here and never passed
you just transcend i know i'm gonna see you again
hoping i'll reach the world leaders and win
ain't nothing without struggle listen up it's critical
we used to fear arms now the weapons are chemical
in hip hop the weapons are lyrical
to be the best you challenge the best and the blessing is spiritual
top of the world for the kid none less
popping any rappers head off his shoulders no contest
i know the most high hear me so far you can't hear me
you scared of a mirror
my theory is that knowledge is power
to every projects and every street corner
we gotta get out of this now

all this hating lasts forever
it's time that we stand together

it was packed on the ryker's bus
the tight cuffs is holdin' me shackled
the life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso
on the streets i was invincible
cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
what my pistol would do a fuckin' killa
mothers of dope fiend embarrassin' me
all in front of my friends
in the street smile with no teeth
i never knew daddy heard he had a 72 caddy
died in a robbery can't remember him was probably 3
why didn't my folks just die in this society
why wasn't i a child of a doctor who left stocks for me
two little brothers two sisters them shortiez gots to eat
mother's a junkie she twisted so all they got is me
i'm the provider with goals to do much better than my father
whether through drugs sold or holdin' revolvers
blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
it comes to me slowly the words he would cry

verse 2 millennium thug
it is i that step up
me that don't give a fuck you that bold then it's all over soldier
hummers and range's through the desert
fuck a 20 inch long as we got gas and we got water
troopers lookin' for manslaughter
i gotta get back for what they owe
shoot'em in the back for the get back
lead through shit bag hold tie gag
forget the life had now we all rebels
everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
we can see 4 miles the land its major rubble
and debris from the earth as we knew crumble

some brothers innocent i pray that i could just escape
how is the war
and yo i'm wishin' i was in your shoes
holdin' machine guns
clean fun shootin' dudes with fatigues on
anywhere is better than this
it's america's plan every color of man inherits the shit
yo i'm startin to think it's all a scheme nobody cares
i know the warden is readin' the scribe

everytime i hear the wind i think a slug went in
i'm checkin' my chest holdin' my head
catchin' my breath watchin' my back

in hospitals shots rittle the block
little children and elderly women run for their lives
drizzling rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
must be out my fucking mind what is this the hundreth time?
sending flowers to funerals reading rest in peace
you know the usual death comes in threes
life is short is what some nigga said
not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
its funny how these black killer companies is making money off us
fast food cola sodas skull and bone crossers

sisters up in my hood trying to do good given choices
when pregnant drop out of school or have abortions
stop working hoping that they find a man that will support them
up late night on they mothers cordless thinking a perm or
bleaching cream will make better when they gorgeous
white girls tanning lypo suction
fake titties are implanted fake lips that's life destruction
lightskin women bi-racial hateful toward themselves
denying even they blood

a thousand times over
every dog has its day and everything flips around
even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to em
everybody reaps what they sew that's how it goes
innocent lives will be taken it may get worse but we'll get through it
y'all be strong

the china-men built the railroad
the indians saved the pilgrim
and in return the pilgrim killed em
they call it it thanksgiving i call your holiday hellday
'cause i'm from poverty neglected by the wealthy

slay bitches and party everyday like this is the last
i'm with my heckles connecting and we hitting the lad
this is my level fuck if it get you mad
it's all poison all of my words to enemies it is poison
rappers only talk about ki's it's all poison
how could you call yourself emcees you ain't poison

this nigga ike with the iverson jersey
light skin with herpees
fuckin' sisters in harlem brooklyn and dc
this is the problem 'cause he never tell 'em he got it
from letting fags suck him off rikers island in nine-three
drives in benz hangs in all the parties
all the concerts backstage where the stars be
rocking their shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
what's your name where you from chain blinging
thinking girls everywheres dumb taking pride in ruining their lives
so they could never have babies and they could never be wives
he never used a condom give him head he got ya
met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster aids
i contemplate believing in karma
those on top could just break and wont be eating tomorrow
i know some bitches who be sleeping on niggas dreams
they leave when they nigga blow she the first bitch on her knees
knowing dudes that's neglecting their seeds
instead of taking care of 'em they spending money on trees
i pray for you deadbeat daddies
'cause when them kids get grown it's too late for you
now you old and you getting shitted on

verse 1 nas
blessings in life to the children
they say life is like 5 days
words of a old man with silver hair in his wheel chair
his eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me
said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
it occurred to me this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
i'm on top now slightest drama i'll have ta kill ya
'cause animals and sweetness sharks smell blood in water
ishmael moses and job moved a divine order
shit is plastic material havin' no life
i crash whips and leave it no matter the price
as long as i survive coppin' the five
circle the block where the beef's at
and park in front of my enemy's eyes
they see that it's war we life stealers
hollow tip lead busters there's no heaven or hell
dead is dead fuckers
and your soul is with god
your mind keeps lurkin' to earth
watchin' your own murder reoccur

chorus repeat 2x
for ever struggle every strip and every ghetto
for every nigga toned in the pain and heavy metal
for every child that's born
and every nigga gone
and for every brotha breathin'
live to see another mornin'

verse 2 blitz
it's blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me
got knocked refused 3 to 9's went to trial for me
basically i'm just reality loaded with vast stories
of lust greed and contempt no street is exempt
extended clip shots hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
i sip shots watchin' 'em hustlers pitch rocks
all you paintin' pictures of my pain
illustrate the city in vain
fallin' deep into the pits of the game
this is for the sickest state of mind
in these fatal times vesh crimes
nickel play the nine and niggas for the dime
hear the sounds of them baby's cry
still i'm sayin' why do we reside
in the ghetto with a million ways to die
stayin' high to relieve the pain
breathin' in the game exhalin'
guilts and the shame misery and strain
what the fuck will tomorrow bring
look at anthrax i stand back through
hopin' i make it tomorrow

verse 3 nas
my skin is a art gallery right
with paintings of crucifixes
hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
but since i tasted paper it started losin the friendships
watchin' kids freeze in winters they still poor
how could i tease them with benz's and feel no remorse
drivin' past them in the lively fashion diamond colors clashin'
red stones blue stones red bones and black ones
fuck did i expect with bucket seats in a lex
and spendin' time in chuckie cheese with little des
got guns when i'm with my daughter
hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
she knows what daddy taught her it's lessons
black princess it's a ugly world
i put my life up for yours see i love that girl
could you believe even my shadow's jealous
my skin is mad at my flesh my flesh hates my own bones
my brain hates my heart my heart makes the songs
though my songs come from the father
i'm lonely
hold me it's gettin' darker",3

sound travels at one thousand one thirty feet per second
niggaz in the street they want it hurry
when niggaz start biting that's when 3000 starts to worry
a little knowledge from the college of wizard ray murray
answer quick do you know what desire is? huh?
apparently not that's why you get what you got
now answer this do you know what fire is? yeah
the body of hot the motivator of pots
snot spit shit are characteristics of release
ask your niece or nephew you think we left you
what the future holds in its sweaty palms
thank i'm finna vom? ya move like ya mean it she'll cum
prom night might excite a down right fight like
white blood cell to the common cold rebel
night gets jealous of day play is no longer
the feelin' gets stronger than ammonia sticks inhale

and we some home-made bombs
finna blow right up in your face

cause you want inside of my head but don't know how
to brainwash me to be a commercial clown

god only knows all the trouble that grows
deep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes

finna blow right up in your face

big boi
with a one-two punch b-real and andre dropped they verses
your homeboy daddy fat sax playin' clean-up so it worsens
people and persons on the opposite teams oh yes its curtains
no bullets burpin' oh just lyrically twerking
making a statement when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state
is kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day
jumpin' the gun and rushing your flow
babbling on the mikie like auctioneer got the public's ears
fucked up can't hear atlanta georgia where y'all at?
outkast this dirty south to death the dungeon family camp
got this thang lit like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps
making that music that make your neck hurt

everything in life don't always happen like it's suppose to
trials and tribulations make you stronger live longer
you wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner
everything don't always happen like you plan it
demand it over stand it then you handle it
fuck wishing you missing the ambition on your mission
now you switching why you quitting 'cause it's heated in the kitchen
sloppy slipping in your pimping nigga
you either pistol whip the nigga or you choke the trigger
you've got to follow through struggle to complete your dreams
no weapon formed against prospers 5417

if the dealer dealt a fucked up hand of cards you've gotta play 'em

too democratic republic fuck it
we chicken nugget we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket
blue-collar scholars who'll take your dollar and wipe my ass wit it
you living for the lotto never hit it i met a critic
i made her shit her drawers
she said she thought hip hop was only guns and alcohol
i said oh hell naw but yet it's that too
you can't discrimahate cause you done read a book or 2
what if i looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms
living in your closet would i stop and would i pause it whoo
to put that bitch in slower motion got the potion and the antidote
and a quote for collision the decision
is do you want to live or wanna exist
the game changes everyday so obsolete is the fist and marches
speeches only reaches those who already know about it
this is how we go about it

erykah badu
i'm wild just like a rock a stone a tree
and i'm free just like the wind the breeze that blows
and i flow just like a brook a stream the rain
and i fly just like a bird up in the sky
and i'll surely die just like a flower plucked
and dragged away and thrown away
and then 1 day it turns to clay
it blows away it finds a ray it finds its way
and there it lays until the rain and sun
then i breathe just like the wind the breeze that blows
and i grow just like a baby breastfeeding
and it's beautiful that's life and that's life
and that's life and that's life

got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'll all be gray but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad

my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'll all be gray but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad

dear slim i wrote but you still ain't callin'
i left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn you must not'a got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'

sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em
but anyways fuck it what's been up? man how's your daughter?
my girlfriend's pregnant too i'm 'bout to be a father
if i have a daughter guess what i'mma call her? i'mma name her bonnie

i read about your uncle ronnie too i'm sorry
i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this everyday but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground shit that you did with skam

i got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
i like the shit you did with rawkus too that shit was phat
anyways i hope you get this man hit me back just to chat
truly yours your biggest fan this is stan

and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'll all be gray but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad

dear slim you still ain't called or wrote i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad i just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
if you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew

that's my little brother man he's only six years old
we waited in the blistering cold for you four hours and you just said no
that's pretty shitty man you're like his fuckin' idol
he wants to be just like you man he likes you more than i do

i ain't that mad though i just don't like bein' lied to
remember when we met in denver you said if i'd write you
you would write back see i'm just like you in a way
i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

i can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when i have a shitty day i drift away and put 'em on
'cause i don't really got shit else so that shit helps when i'm depressed
i even got a tattoo of your name across the chest

sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real and i respect you cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous 'cause i talk about you twenty-four/seven

but she don't know you like i know you slim no-one does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me man i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
sincerely yours stan
ps we should be together too

my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'll all be gray but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad

dear mr i'm-too-good-to-call-or-write-my-fans
this'll be the last package i ever send your ass
it's been six months and still no word i don't deserve it?
i know you got my last two letters i wrote the addresses on 'em perfect

so this is my cassette i'm sending you i hope you hear it
i'm in the car right now i'm doing 90 on the freeway
hey slim i drank a fifth of vodka you dare me to drive?
you know the song by phil collins in the air tonight?

about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning?
but didn't then phil saw it all then at a show he found him?
that's kinda how this is you coulda rescued me from drowning
now it's too late i'm on a thousand downers now i'm drowsy

and all i wanted was a lousy letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i love you slim we coulda been together think about it
you ruined it now i hope you can't sleep and you dream about it

and when you dream i hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
i hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
see slim shut up bitch i'm tryin' to talk
hey slim that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk

but i didn't slit her throat i just tied her up see i ain't like you
'cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
well gotta go i'm almost at the bridge now - oh shit i forgot
how am i supposed to send this shit out?

my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'll all be gray but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad

dear stan i meant to write you sooner but i just been busy
you said your girlfriend's pregnant now how far along is she?
look i'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother i wrote it on the starter cap

i'm sorry i didn't see you at the show i musta missed you
don't think i did that shit intentionally just to diss you
but what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
i say that shit just clownin' dogg c'mon how fucked up is you?

you got some issues stan i think you need some counselling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
and what's this shit about us meant to be together?
that type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other

i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this letter i just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself i think that you'll be doin' just fine

if you relax a little i'm glad i inspire you but stan
why are you so mad? try to understand that i do want you as a fan
i just don't want you to do some crazy shit

hey yo turn the beat up a little bit
hey yo this song is for anyone fuck it just shut up and listen
hey yo

i sit back with this pack of zig-zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this on this earth
and since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse

and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
that's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

and i rest again peacefully peacefully
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out
in the streets when i'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

to not come and speak to me speak to me
i don't know you and no i don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
i'm not mr nsync i'm not what your friends think
i'm not mr friendly i can be a prick

if you tempt me my tank is on empty is on empty
no patience is in me and if you offend me
i'm liftin' you 10 feet 10 feet in the air
i don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
i'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
i'm tired of arguin' of arguin
i don't mean to be mean but that's all i can be it's just me

and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio won't even play my jam

'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i don't know it's just the way i am

sometimes i just feel like my father i hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
and oh it's his lyrical content
that song guilty conscience has gotten such rotten responses

and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me finger at me
so i point one back at 'em but not the index or pinky

or the ring or the thumb it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too
when a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

and they blame it on marilyn on marilyn and the heroin
where were the parents at? and look where it's at
middle america now it's a tragedy
now it's so sad to see an upper class city

havin' this happenin' this happenin' 
then attack eminem 'cause i rap this way rap this way
but i'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire
to burn and it's burnin' and i have returned

and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio won't even play my jam

'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i don't know it's just the way i am

i'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label let's stop with the fables
i'm not gonna be able to top on my name is

and pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
that copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
and i just do not got the patience got the patience
to deal with these cocky caucasians

who think i'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'cause i talk with an accent and grab on my balls
so they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions fuckin' questions
what school did i go to what hood i grew up in?

the why the who what when the where and the how
till i'm grabbin' my hair and i'm tearin' it out ahhh
'cause they drivin' me crazy me crazy
i can't take it i'm racin' i'm pacin' i stand and i sit

and i'm thankful for every fan that i get
but i can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
no i won't sign your autograph
you can call me an asshole i'm glad

'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am

hey yo this is my love song
it goes like this

back when mark wahlberg was marky mark
this is how we used to make the party start
we used to mix henn' with bacardi dark
and when it kicks in you can hardly talk

and by the sixth gin you gon' probably crawl
and you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
and my prediction is that you gon' probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall

and everything's spinning you're beginning to think
women are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
you are now allowed to officially slap bitches

you have the right to remain violent and start wildin'
start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyeing you
get in the car and start it and start driving
over the island and cause a 42-car pileup

earth calling pilot to co-pilot
looking for life on this planet sir no sign of it
all i can see is a bunch of smoke flying
and i'm so high that i might die if i go by it

let me out of this place i'm outta place
i'm in in outer space i've just vanished without a trace
i'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
i'll be back in an hour or so

'cause every time i go to try to leave whoa
something keeps pulling on my sleeve whoa
i don't wanna but i gotta stay whoa
these drugs really gotta hold of me whoa

'cause every time i try to tell 'em no no
they won't let me ever let 'em go go
i'm a sucker all i gotta say whoa
drugs really gotta hold of me whoa

in third grade all i used to do
was sniff glue through a tube and play rubik's cube
seventeen years later i'm as rude as jude
scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs

i got no game and every face looks the same
they got no name so i don't need game to play
i just say whatever i want to whoever i want
whenever i want wherever i want however i want

however i do show some respect to few
this ecstasy's got me standing next to you
getting sentimental as fuck spilling guts to you
we just met but i think i'm in love with you

but you're on it too so you tell me you love me too
wake up in the morning like yo what the fuck we do?
i gotta go bitch you know i got stuff to do
'cause if i get caught cheating then i'm stuck with you

but in the long run these drugs are probably gonna catch up sooner or later
but fuck it i'm on one so let's enjoy
let the x destroy your spinal cord
so it's not a straight line no more

so we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
shit sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
shit six hits won't even get me high no more
so bye for now i'm gonna try to find some more

'cause every time i go to try to leave whoa
something keeps pulling on my sleeve whoa
i don't wanna but i gotta stay whoa
these drugs really gotta hold of me whoa

'cause every time i try to tell 'em no no
they won't let me ever let 'em go go
i'm a sucker all i gotta say whoa
these drugs really gotta hold of me whoa

that's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
when you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
and tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
what's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? screw it

and what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
and what's a little fight? tomorrow you'll be boys again
it's your life live it however you wanna
marijuana is everywhere where was you brought up?

it don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're going
they tell you to stop but you just sit there ignoring
even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning

but you're young you got a lot of drugs to do
girls to screw parties to crash sucks to be you
if i could take it all back now i wouldn't
i woulda did more shit that people said that i shouldn't

but i'm all grown up now and upgraded
and graduated to better drugs and updated
but i still gotta a lot of growing up to do
i still gotta whole lot of throwing up to spew

but when it's all said and done i'll be forty
before i know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
with a bottle of jack two grandkids on my lap
babysitting for hailie while hailie's out getting smashed

'cause every time i go to try to leave whoa
something keeps pulling on my sleeve whoa
i don't wanna but i gotta stay whoa
these drugs really gotta hold of me whoa

'cause every time i try to tell 'em no no
they won't let me ever let 'em go go

with a gun and a knife in our waistband
went to war with the devil and shaytan
he wore a bad toupee and a spray tan
so high now hoping that i land

on the radio heard a plane hijack
government did that like they cook crack
i move in a world of conspiracies
obey no rules i'm doing me
smoke kush transport to the airport
customs found a joint in my passport
pull cash and i gave him what he asked for

small bribe made it back into america
hit uber and maneuvered out the area

brought gas and the matches to flare it up

born black that's dead on arrival

wake up roll an eighth up
throw a double finger with a fist
here at the abyss
i will be your tour guide
it is war time check your wrists ready kids?
over to your right shine a light
got a bevy ready for the fight
i just wanna live i don't wanna ever have to load a clip
only hunt bliss
i am still a kid in my heart
but these motherfuckers sick
they don't give a shit not at all
they don't even want to let you take a little piss in a pot
listen along
they don't want your love shit is bugged
motherfuckers steady getting rich from the blood
love when you beg
trust i would sooner put a puckered pair of lips to the sun
love will survive
run out under iridescent lights for our lives
i will be surprised if we ever got the feeling so alive as tonight
wild for the night
look into my eyes
i am standing at your side for the fight

they don't see the size of the fight

clean oil my kaliashnikov
stockpile ten for me and friends in case shit get to poppin' off

telling you to pick your master for president
then behind the curtain seen the devil workin'
came back with some evidence
i'm here to tell you don't let 'em tell you what's right wrong
make love smoke kush try to laugh hard and live long
that's the antidote
you defeat the devil when you hold onto hope
'cause kinfolk life is beautiful
and we ain't gotta die for them other men
and i refuse to kill another human being
in the name of a government
'cause i don't study war no more
i don't hate the poor no more
gettin' more ain't what's more
only thing more is the love
so when you see me
please greet me with a heart full
and a pound and a hug

she said excuse me lil homey i know you don't know me
but my name is windy and i like to blow trees
and from that point i never blow her off
niggas come from out of town i like to show her off
they like to act tough she like to tow 'em off
and make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
and when i grew up she showed me how to go downtown
in the nighttime her face lit up so astounding
i told her in my heart is where she'll always be
she never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
she said it felt like they walked and drove on me
knew i was gang affiliated got on tv and told on me
i guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
she said 'ye keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me

kanye west
but if you really cared for her
then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
sometimes i still talk to her but when i talk to her
it always seems like she talking 'bout me
she said you left your kids and they just like you
they want to rap and make soul beats just like you
but they just not you and i just got through
talking 'bout what we tryna do just not new
now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
i guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
i guess that's why i'm here and i can't come back home
and guess when i heard that? when i was back home
every interview i'm representing you making you proud
reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave 'em around
if you don't know by now i'm talking 'bout chi-town

not only did i not get a chance to spit it
carline told me i could buy two tickets
i guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
and kept little brother at bay at a distance
but everything that i felt was more bogus
only made me more focused only wrote more potent
only thing i wanna know is why i get looked over
i guess i'll understand when i get more older
big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
now i'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

my big brother was big's brother
used to be dame and biggs brother
who was hip hop brother who was no id friend
no id my mentor now let the story begin begin
let the story begin
if you feel the way i feel why don't you wave your hands?

have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
not only a client the presidito hola hovito
the game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
i was always on the other side of the peephole
then i dropped jesus walks now i'm on the steeple
and we know new jack city got to keep my brother
but to be number one i'mma beat my brother
on that diamonds remix i swore i spazzed
then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
sibling rivalry only i could see
it was the pride in me that was drivin' me
at the grammys i said i inspired me
but my big brother who i always tried to be
when i kicked a flow it like pick-and-roll
'cause even if he gave me the rock it's give-and-go
i guess beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
but my shit was more like a finger roll
but i had them singles though
and them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh y'all know
i told jay i did a song with coldplay
next thing i know he got a song with coldplay
back in my mind i'm like damn no way
translate español no way jose
then i went and told jay brown
shoulda known that was gonna come back around
shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
but i told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

my big brother was big's brother
so here's a few words from ya kid brother
if you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
people never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
a idol in my eyes god of the game
heart of the city roc-a-fella chain
never be the same never be another
number one young hov also my big brother

my big brother was big's brother
used to be dame and biggs brother

where parents are embarrassed to tell you they raise they kids at
you need some half and half or an 8-ball you can get that
fuck with little rodney and you'll get all of your ribs cracked

and the sellers and the smokers are both patient
got one eye on minneapolis pd they both racin'
3 for 50 is the supply and demand in the
twin cities' american heartland and they
been busy masterminds tearing apart plans
and hoop dreamers ballin' with blisters on they hands
with chains danglin' from the rims
pain strangles 'em from within
till the belt around the arm makes the veins stand at attention

i try to block it out with a bed sheet the moonlight's as a curtain
'cause i'm not comforted by red and blue lights when i'm hurtin'
mommy loves you yeah i knew but i wasn't certain
'cause the lenses through which she views life wasn't workin'
as a boy she told me wait till your father to come home
i'm 24 still waitin' for my father to come home
and some parents only touch they children when a whips brought
that's why bad kids do bad shit just so they could caught
and get touched this growing up shit's rough
that's a big part of why were so mixed up
shit we don't have bar mitzvah's
we become men the first time our father hits us
and we don't open gifts up
sister regina from across the street is beautiful
but for 50 bucks ain't nothing she won't do to you
used to be premium pussy now she used up
for that same 50 bucks she got to do some new stuff
whatever it takes for you to take the dollars out
if you don't intervene then there's a day she'll turn her daughter out
speaking of kids i'm fixing lunch for my first born
i had the windows wide open 'cause the weather's warm
that's when the greatest hits of donnie hathaway
got interrupted by a drive-by shooting half a block away
vaheem was in the window he didn't get hit though

i weave a web of words so intricately
that the english dictionary lacks an adjective to fit me
if he want my album tell him not to fuck with atak
he was hatin' and slug told the bitch to send my tapes back
and if i lose my voice then instead of sayin' raps
i start paintin facts on the wall with hot crayola crayon wax

you need to stop and understand me son

i'm like big up my man optimus prime
i'm like what the fuck do rappers got in they mind?
i might jump on the stage and start hollerin rhymes
maybe bend your back around and make you swallow your spine
'cause it's clear you ain't seen no one this tight in years
when i sing i can bring brian mcknight to tears
i have to consume ali capture a room

only gold plaque that i got had the qu'ran on it
i fliped your eviction notice over wrote a song on it
like to hear it here it go light your spirit clear your soul
if i would've known that tonight was ladie's night
i would've stopped and swabbed my balls with the baby whipe
in the van hold your sorry little life in my hand
watch me toss it in the sky and swing right for the stands
battling me is like trying to ride your bike in the sand
i'ma eat one more helping then i'm whiping my hands
and you frustrated rappers must hate the fact
that i walk in first class have so much ladies gaspin for breath
tryin' to catch me with the ass and the chest
i ain't tryin' to be rude lady i'm just passin a test
got enough hastle and stress with one woman cashing my cheques

excuse me i mean pardon me
i mean you got me so shook i can hardly see
and i ain't tryin' to be foul or disrespectful or nothin'
but i feel like the universe should tell you somethin'
you somethin' and i don't say that to be sayin' it
many came and went but baby you the main event
that's why i stopped ya it's not just the body parts
that made me watch ya mama you got the posture

and i'm prince charming girl pleased to meet ya
i could be your student you could be my teacher
and i'm majorin your idiosyncrasies
and i please trouble you to use a word with 'w'
the way your lips movin got me pluggin too
you a great ten frame draped in heaven-made skin
and a faint grin can a church say amen?
but why you catchin the bus?
with your backpockets lookin' like they're ready to bust

third date can't stop fate
i know you can relate 'cause i can see it in your face
it's time to take this thing we got to the next level
you know i mean spend all our waking hours together
surprise showed up at your job again
and i took the time to interview all of your friends
i don't think they good enough for a queen like you
in fact cuttin' them bitches off the first thing you need to do
i was thinkin' i wanna be everything to you
i'm the only friend you'll ever need man that's true
besides i bought you a beeper so i can reach ya
anytime i need ya you in the streets just
cluckin and cluckin and cluckin and cluckin

won't you come on through give daddy some of that honey girl

did you have to go and tell the law you scared of me?
they came to mama's house and embarrassed me
can't no piece of paper keep me away from you
you just don't understand how much i love you
i tried to tell you that i was sorry with a card
but i found it in the garbage in your backyard
everytime i get involved it's some shit that happen
girl you start out nice then forget your manners
let me tell you that's what's wrong with these women today
how you gon' have a good man feelin' this way?
it's a 30 second message that i left you today

time to see who got the testicles
i'm not the type to holler what you wanna do then?
hands parallel to my shoulders i keep it movin
there's one thing i hate is for another man to take control
of a situation you don't want me to play the role
i'm in my element on front street i love a spotlight
bringin' an audience to diss me is just not right
i told him listen stupid i know what you're here to do
but we're not gonna do it
this is a movement that i'm part of it
you're lucky i'm a righteous blackman
and you thought i had issues now really had 'em back then
i turned my back with the anti-climatic spitefulness
that's the worst type of diss
and i stepped off adolescent passive aggressive
jesus christ superstar to send the world a message
and there stood little man soft dick in hand
wonderin what the fuck just happened? not enough to kill a man
i turn the corner like as long as he ain't pullin a gun
i'd rather catch a ass-whippin than run

i put them out there bad too really they had to
i turned around they runnin' right directly at me they looked mad too
a half a minute felt like a half an hour
when he got close enough i stuck him once for black power
all three bombed on me started swingin' me around
hollerin get him down get him down
i'm like fuck that y'all don't gettin' me on the linoleum
so three white boys can start stompin only one
they didn't hold back at all
they started bangin' my head against a steel locker like a freakin racket ball
grill was all busted the locker was rusted
and when my face hit it it split my bicuspid
they spilled blood on my 'boys n the hood increase the peace' t-shirt
now isn't that symbolic?
i came to school a week later with a eye full of stitches
and i held my head higher than bitches
they lookin' at me like yeah y'all done fucked me up
what you think that's a thing that's gonna shut me up?
shit nope still swaggerin still battle rappin'
and still not givin' 'em the satisfaction of bein mad",3

the way that children act when the stars come out

pursue something tight within the blue ugly life they're in

i bitchslap rappers so hard it give 'em whiplash
you fuckin' with sleeveless t-shirts where your tricks at?
look left look right wait where your chick at?
she findin out she walk and talk right provide dick pipe
i'm a big baller shot caller all a y'all are runnin' laps
let me tell you little fuckers a story walkin' out
you probably think you're somebody big talkin' loud
you're transparent i been starin' through your karl kani
art imitates life imitates art
get it straight slice through the mic pourin out my heart
when it's late night we litter the landscape
animate our dead opposition to get one last phoney handshake
i read a lot and write a lot empty my pockets at the giro shop
hit the cash machine for some green maybe a ten spot
i said giro cause my greek's a little broken
but my four-letter french works fine if you're provokin

and we killers in the morning killers in the evening
wake up and we yawnin happy we still breathin
got one longin that's to keep eatin
we here to stay and we ain't leavin'

rock y'all
everything gonna be all right

i'm a cross between john gotti and mahatma gandhi
look between pimp and square you probably find me
there in vain i solemnly swear
i'm a guardian angel with gang signs in the air
i spent too much time fuckin' with sorry sobs
treatin beats like bitches flippin ménage à trois's
you ain't tryin' to see us angry pop we already hard
fuckin' the the diplomats'll get you horribly scarred
from the cat behind the wall who play handball in the yard
to the one that run the block as head baller in charge
to the brothers with the kufis on that walk with the gods
mission hill caprini green all ghetto scenery
every city got us beaten up down tryin' creepin' up
soundbombing people what? till we get a equal cut
we come through straight smashin on the haters
witness the world the rhymesayers

rock y'all
everything gonna be all right

often the brain runs
and expresses itself in words sometimes profane ones
that's when it first occurred to me where the pain comes
from page one in my rhyme book
if you listen closely you can picture how my line looks
you presently pressed to be restin next to me
the best of me molestin destiny wrestlin with ecstacy
the recipe for immoratlity
flows actually be on the malls and factories
of urban life with the laws of gravity
audacity you got a lot of it
common sense should tell you not to rap against
my obvious dominance
my real lilfe size is bigger than your confidence",3

show promoter backstage pacin' why is that?
he's tryin' to take control of his situation
he know damn well he ain't got the money i expect to have
so i'm stuffin all the backstage in my record bag
but that's what you get when you don't pay shit
'cause i can't pay my rent on free water and chips
and if free beer means payment is what you think
bk drank one and ali don't drink
so produce the fetti cheddar or whatever you call it
go get your dough split and come the hell up off it
this is how i feed my family so i'm not gonna forfeit
and if that doesn't get it i'm gonna go for your wallet
let me guess - the turnout wasn't quite what you expected
let me guess - somethin' that the club owner did wrecked it
let me guess - it's hard to pack 'em in in this kind of weather
and nobody wanna come and party after 9/11
that's not a mp that's a yp - your problem
you need to have this shit planned out before callin
this is not a game to me dog you stealin from my family
you just gon' have to understand me
backstage pacin'

verse 2 brother ali
opening act backstage pacin' why is that?
they tryin' take control of they situation
but they mad salty 'cause they wore they fuckin' matchin' shirts
and the crowd didn't feel them and they went on first
it's the monitor the soundman it's the muthafuckin mics
cats in this state are haters and the whole crowd's white
don't sleep your wu-tang impression is tight
and if blah-blah would have happened y'all'd had 'em snappin
let me guess - you and your girl had a conversation
let me guess - she doesn't feel that you're being compensated
let me guess - you've been rappin' for a year and a half
and you mad brave when you get a little beer in your ass
at this stage y'all really need to show and prove
pay attention pay respect pay homage pay your dues
be happy with your 20 minutes and your drink tickets
and go build your own scene if you think different
hah 'cause we ain't even triyn to take y'all shit
the micronauts should have pinky rings to make y'all kiss
it's a road now but who you think paved all this?
you're mad-face makin' you're lucky to be backstage pacin'

brother ali backstage pacin' why is that?
he tryin' to take control of his situation
he's a million miles from home and his dick is on hard
and these girls are gonna make him prove that he believe in god
i'm haunted by an overfriendly poetry chick
who keeps showin me hip 'cause she know that she thick
and if i met her on the street i probably wouldn't look twice
but at a show with my ego on swoll she look like
a master at applyin maybelline with thighs you'd love to lay between
hair was fly with raving sheen gigantic eyes in hazel green
revealin just enough to let me know she got it
but concealin just enough to let imagination frolic
let me guess - my poetry makes you feel so inspired
let me guess - the way i play off the vibe makes you excited
let me guess - you wanna go and party after the show
and you were hopin that the two of us could capture the flow
she like come on ali it ain't nothin' to dance
by the end of the song girl i be rubbin your ass
and by the end of the night i might be fuckin' you fast
then my wife probably find a new husband and dash",3

turn up the mics let me speak to them

it all starts when the beat begins

verse 1 brother ali
you're now fuckin' with the show stopper
a-l-i the brother since '89's the number
fuck another summer i'm the world's most accurate
take the roughest cats and get 'em passionate
shake awake the walking dead lazarus
with off-the-head narratives it'm embarrassing
i mean i'm the albino but y'all pale in comparison
i'm not arrogant oh shit well yeah i'm arrogant
grab the microphone out your arm so fast i tear a limb
roman fashion give yo soul a spasm
if you don't know find someone that knows and ask him
i'm right in front of ya tight muthafuckin mic muzzler
who might struggle ya my shit's wild like that
there's 8 million ways to stretch words around beats
and 6 million rappers be sharin the same three
but me takin' the time to be creative with mine
touch your soul till i see it in your face when i rhyme
and in the two or three seconds it may take to rewind
i hold a rapper to the flames until i make him resign
want nobody hold your place in this rhyme you find a space to recline
you're dead got to stay breakin your spine

every father mother son and daughter send 'em to me
do not approach the ock without bendin your knees
i might be on the stage but my head's in the streets
we settle the beef when the beats commence --&gt run-dmc

verse 2 brother ali
ladies and gentlemen brother ali bare the resemblance
of moses freein y'all with sentences vocabulary venomous
telling domestic horror stories
non-fiction with the majestic oratory
instead of concentratin on strippin the youth naked
i give 'em the truth naked livin' proof for the sacred
unless i'm mistaken there's like three kind of people
black people and white people and my people
i blister mc's and let em' twist in the breeze
i got a funny knack for bringin' kids to their knees
y'all got christopher reeve-sized bravery tryin' to play with me
have you in fetal positions shoutin get away from me
every day i see rappers i wanna slap or strangle
around they neck disaster dangles so that's the angle
next millennium same percentage of 'em are weak
y'all thinkin' y'all can rhyme don't even come from the streets
you got any sense at all you mean-mug and retreat
or end up a human pinada hung from your feet
when i told you you were tight i had my tongue in my cheek
and you ain't lookin' at my team buddy our huddle is deep
born to hustle on beats i just have it within
if i had any more potential i would have to be twins
cackle and grin when rappers begin to babble and spit away
y'all should pick a day the it-day the off-the-ick day

verse 3 brother ali
i'm a desperado but i guess that y'all know that already
my stick-and-move flow pattern steady
the bro has already dissed rappers of every race
got 'em together for a we are the world remake
if ali's fake please take this opportunity to tell he
to his face get your infrastructure erased
when i flip damn it i'm fly kick sand in your eye
and tell your record company to eat a shit sandwich and die
ali's a big teddybear
till they scream stop slammin' the car door that's my fuckin' head in there
your teeth are everywhere i serve your family
and write about it in my journal like i'm mister belvedere
i seldom stare in the sky only at nighttime
envision endin your mission when i write rhymes
history's never witnessed a mission quite like mine
and the more they try to extinguish it the more the light shines",3
13,"i dictate while most mc's lactate
can't wait for me to smack greats and fuck 'em till my sack breaks
they stand still with a little bit of spittle
drippin' off the middle of they lips tryin' to light a cigarette

and i'mma watch 'em all choke on my vomit
took apart shook up they heart they died on it
and i promise if you could hide from this monster
you'd quit tryin' to ride on my divide and conquer

some gotta die 'fore the dumb realize
not everyone can fly most don't have wings
keep takin' a nap wear a brick for a cap
or get the fuck off the lap before you lose everything

i spit shrapnel while the villagers babble
slice deep pull peel and let the skin unravel
we're here to scrape off a layer of your make-up
so we can see what a bitch is really made of

i step off in your hoola-hoop cypher with my eyes all aglow
walkin' tall enough to make your half moon whole
you don't need to get duct-taped to the bathroom floor
'cause i don't think your shit is flavor - the rats do though

you and your little bitch buddies think you're thelma and louise
'cause you got a drum machine and you throw jealous to the breeze
you need to respect a fuckin' legend when he breathes
'fore you get a k-swiss logo embedded in your knees

shock the body-body rock the consciousness
stagger the imagination box your esophagus
the paradigm you stepped past the line
and i show you why the masterminds have got a fuckin' axe to grind

street magician like david blaine with these songs
crypt-walkin' through your mental corridor with metal cleats on
slug got the weed smoke ant got the beats broke
and your fuckin' eyebrows might grow back but your teeth won't

you gonna look pretty funny tryin' to eat corn on a cob with no fuckin' teeth",3
14,"here we are in the apartment corridor
dorian right? yeah i been meaning to speak to you
i don't get up in my neighbours business normally right
but yo these thin ass walls got everything leakin' through
now first thing's first i don't judge you for the weed smoke
but i can hear your daughter yellin' daddy please don't
and it's not once or twice but every damn night
man there's somethin' goin' on up in here that ain't right
now man to man i can understand
they like to stress a brotha out man we cuss each other out
but you crossin the line by puttin' your hands on 'em
and nobody ever told you not to hit a damn woman?
boy i can tell that my presence was painfull
breathin' truth down his neck it must have felt like a strangle
his eyes flashed confusion wavin' his hands around
he's used to raisin' his voice on people to back 'em down

see this is specifically why i left the pistol in the linen closet
pullin' this shit if he was taller i woulda went and got it
damnit man i'm in the right and i'm civilized
but little boys really ain't used to bein' criticized
first off scooter take the bass out your voice
i'm respectfull with mine and yo you makin' a choice
here and understand it's only once that i warn you
man make a move make a threat i'll make it reign knuckles on you
i ain't a woman or a baby dawg i'm out of your league
my wife heard us gettin' loud so she's prayin' for peace
she's stuck her head down on some keep your temper shit
little man gon' say over there's your door mind your business bitch
ha now that's sweet just what i needed it it seemed that
he invited my right fist for a party on his left cheek
i didn't mean to seem rude so i accepted
but arrived a half a second early right cross connected -
oh staggered him just by taggin' him
mr tough guy one punch bring out the fag in him
little man could make moves that i couldn't
he cut and tried to foot it now how should i put it
i stood at full posture and swatted him down the staircase
bare knuckles to bare face all punches knew their place
air point style the second one take off the next one land
learn some respect young man
he glanced down for the brick on the ground
fist still clenched up i'm still stickin' his crown
he's in the jaws of the most turbulant blitz in the world
so fuck hittin' ya' girl tonight you're hittin' the ground
i said somebody need to beat your ass
and then teach your ass and i'm sorry i can only do half
and while his mellon swell up a police cruiser pull up
he hopped out all puffed up with the holster of his gun up
ready to protect and serve
and it's in his nature to 38 ya' if you're testin' his nerves
he helped the wife-beater stand up
but not before he helped brother ali into some handcuffs
and you can imagine my surprise
when his girl came down the stairs with tears in her eyes
and a phone in her hand holdin' her man
damn that was not the plan",3

16,"i was up and out my mothers house at 17
been a grown ass married man ever since
family reunions i'm talked about but never seen
'cause i learned that some of them can be your nemesis
got a lot of scars on me i'll now tell you the stories
if you promise not to take offense
homie sit back then hand bring the beat in
i'll try to find a place that starts to make sense now
the first time i was pushed out blind
cold and naked spanked on the ass to breathe
an immigrant from heaven on earth with a work visa
i announce my self with gasps and screams
before black and white supremacy heighted my innocence
i was living out life behind the picket fence
happy go lucky scared of no one
with the only exception i'm allergic to the sun
didn't know i had a image that a camera couldn't capture
100% allah's manufacture
but then came the laughter and outside i'm battered
picket fence shattered
i saw my self as bastard tagalong harassed and spat upon
by the children of slave masters who passed it on
the saddest songs been sung at the hands of who i call the race from hell
it's a disgrace from hell
fell face first in the self hate
burst into tears when i hear my own hellish name cursed
if i seem timid its only because every mirror that i saw back then had the
earths ugliest human being in it
and with that said they would kick me till they got tired or i act dead
and i have to tell y'all that the obvious part
that i always feel free when i'm talking to god
alone on the playground friday afternoon
and the old sister who hums gospel toons
i saw her notice getting closer
she approached me and put a knowing hand on my shoulder
and booked my feelings
'cause she looked at me in a way that adults very seldom look at children
and with the wisdom only earned by years
she read my thoughts and she welled up with tears and said

you look the way you do because you're special
not the short bus way i mean that god's gonna test you
and all of this pain is training for the day when you
will have to lead with the gift god gave to you
grown folks don't see it but the babies do
and there's a chance that you can save a few
and time will prove that she started my movement
she didn't tell me to take it - she told me to use it

the second time poppa ripped the womb open early
and exposed me to the coldness life prematurely
where mom's love used to live now housed denial
and when that decayed it made it bitter and spiteful
but me and my runaway we share something special
rode into the sunset can barely can tough the pedals
no strings attached screaming fuck geppetto
we may live in the gutter but we cling to each other

a week before my son came i caught a bad bounce
and had to step to mom with my hands out
and momma proved the two of us could not live in that house
she lied to the police so they would throw us in the streets
and separating from you is something that i feel i must do
it's not that i don't love you its more that i don't trust you
it's been a year since i've seen a living relative
and it's just now that i'm starting to live
but while i'm sitting here choking on tears wishing that i didn't care
feeling all alone in this hemisphere i swear upon everything i hold dear
and then my wife comes near and i hear a voice whisper in my ear

you're going through all of this because you're special
not no superstar shit i mean that god had to test you
and all of this pain has been training for the day when you
would lead us with the gift god gave to you
your parents might not see it but your babies do
and there's a chance that you can save a few
and time will prove that she started my movement
she didn't tell me to take it she told me to use it

so i use it",3

verse 1 brother ali
step inside the mind of a soon-to-be legendary
straight paramilitary
brother ali exist to read the scripture it's never read
whoever said this underground hip-hop shit is dead
must have fallen on his head
spent my lifetime buildin
writin rhymes i remind rappers of everything that scared them as children
they call me show stopper
no opera singer has hit the exact pitch i spit my flow out of
taught directly by the source of all knowledge
you don't affect me till you're forced to draw powers
respect me as a voice amongst scholars
who speak deep to thee move the sleep from your eye lids
make your lungs flutter
get it right my inner light cast shadows on the sun brother
i'm where the rubber meets the concrete
it's a cold world not sayin' bring your your own heat
i'm just sayin' don't sleep
i'm walkin' with the lion till the day that i die
and the pens have been lifted and the pages have dried
and a big smoke screen wrote my name in the sky
politickin with the angels knowin' they would reply
got the lungs of a cyclone tongue of a python
the reason why your favorite mc sleep with the lights on
right on brother we def as fuck
not 'deaf' like what? but 'def' like what
from the depths around the planet where my name's spoken
we here to get our brains open and our chains broken
watch me walk around the planet with the same notion
his adversaries thought the pain broke him
but we run up in a stadium with diagnostics
two tables and a mic and take a crowd hostage
and the very first item on my list of demands
is that all these freedom fighters start liftin they hands

to my freedom fighters and the graffiti writers
and the people like us - come forward
and to the torch carriers speakin' arabic
ridin' on your charriots - come forward
to my political prisoners individual listeners
who feelin' this - come forward
and to the bone shakers and the home makers
raisin our own saviors - come forward

verse 2 brother ali
me and my people are signed sealed delivered incorporated
brought to your by rhymesayers entertainment
you got to face it we not complacent
we came for your debasement and left your face bent
and me mister brother ali is the stomp-down-beat-kicker
who walkin' the streets with the so real philosophy
until i fulfill prophecy there's no real stoppin' me
obviously i'm the bomb believe me
opponents come up missin' and they all beneath me
i know my soldiers need me they call and beep me
i walk the streets freely with ? beneath me boy
we stays gettin' it on
act hard and i probably make you strip to your thong
dissin your song and feel you mouth to fist when you yawn
nibblin on a rapper till the gristle is gone
i stand and sing from atop mount ararat
i am a king just ain't got my kingdom yet
and my anthem ring from the congo to your set
i'm alfred hitchcock with my silhouette
pourin blood on beats till the trumpet is blown

my homie marley used to stay 79th and may
one of my best friends from back in the day
down the street from calumet a school for the stones
he nicknamed me k-rock so they would leave me alone
bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
and walked around the mall with his radio face off
plus he had the spinner from his daytons in his hand
keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man
back when we rocked ellesses he had dreams of caprices
drove by the teachers even more by polices
how'd he get the cash? the day his father passed away
left him with a little somethin' sixteen he was stuntin'
al b sure nigga with the hair all wavy
hit lake shore girls go all crazy
hit the freeway go at least 'bout eighty
boned so much that summer even had him a baby
see back-back then-then if you had a car
you was the chi-town version of baby
and i was just a virgin a baby
one of the reasons i looked up to him crazy
i used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
felt like i was almost signed when the shit got cranked
we'd take a saturday and just circle the mall
they had they lincolns and auroras we was hurtin' 'em all
with the girls a lot of flirtin' involved but dog
fuck all that flirtin' i'm tryin' to get in some drawers
so put me on with these hoes homie
he told me don't rush to get grown drive slow homie

what it do? i'm posted up in the parking lot my trunk waving
the candy gloss is immaculate it's simply amazing
them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'lac
trunk open screens on neons lit with fifth relaxed
i'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
allow me to introduce you to my cl mercedes
it's a star-studded event when i valet park
open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
you see them fours crawling? you see them screens falling?
the disco ball in my mouth insinuates i'm ballin'
i'm leaning on the switch sitting crooked in my slab
but i could still catch boppers if i drove a cab
a young houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
ridin' something candy coated crawling like a caterpillar
i'm tipping on them fours i'm jamming on that screw
i'm looking for them hoes baby what it do? drive slow homie

glc and kanye west
turn your hazard lights of when you see them hoes drive slow homie
if you're riding around the city with nowhere to go drive slow homie
live today 'cause tomorrow man you never know
you never know homie might meet some hoes homie
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

my car's like the movie my car's like the crib
i got more tvs in here than where i live
and that don't make no sense but baby i'm the shit
and everything i flip you know it's something serious
i got the custom grill i got the brabus rims
i got the baller genetics baby this evidence
you see a player flicking and how you ain't convinced
that you should go on and kiss it just a little bit just a little bit
i got my custom kicks i got my jesus chain
my canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
they see me hoes actin' like they seen a king
with that mean lean smoking on that finest cali green
my woodgrain oak i'm ridin' on vogues

they say home is where the hate is my dome is where fate is
i stroll where souls get lost like vegas
seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
pray to god that my arms reach the masses
the young smoke grass in grassless jungles
rubber band together in cashless bundles
we wear strugglin' chains divided only hustle remains
makin' sense of it we hustle for change
revolution ain't a game it's another name for life fightin'
someone to stay in they corner like mike tyson
hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
show money becomes bail relationships become jail
children are unheld i wish love was for sale
behold the pale horse got me trapped like r kell i bail and it

you fixed me up somethin' that was good for my soul
famous homemade chicken soup can i have another bowl?

mommy got me training wheels so i could keep on my bike
and you would give anything in this world
michael jackson leather and a glove but didn't give me a curl
and you never put no man over me
and i love you for that mommy can't you see?
7 years old i caught you with tears in your eyes
cause a nigga cheatin' tellin' you lies then i started to cry
as we knelt on the kitchen floor
i said mommy i'm a love you so you don't hurt no more
and when i'm older you ain't gotta work no more
and i'm a get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
see your unbreakable unmistakable
highly capable lady that's makin' loot

hey mama i wanna scream so loud for you 'cause i'm so proud of you
and let me tell you what i'm about to do hey mama
i know i act a fool but i promise you i'm goin' back to school
and i appreciate what you allowed for me
and i just want you to be proud of me
hey mama

somethin' to fall back on you could profit with
but still supported me when i did the opposite
now i feel like it's things i gotta get
things i gotta do just to prove to you
you was gettin' through can the choir please
give me a verse of you are so beautiful to me?

consequence
i been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
and trying to help his mama with the fact that her child gone
and since we used to bubble like a tub full of calgon
guess it's only right that i should help her from now on
but since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong?
now they asking cons how long has this gone on?
and maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the feds
so i had gone to the dread but he had gone up to bed
and when i came the next morning he was gone with my bread
and with that being said i had gone on my instincts
and gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
but looking back now i should've gone to the crib
and rented gone with the wind 'cause i'd a-gone in by ten
but i had gone with my friend and we had gone to the bar
and heard a nigga talking shit so i had gone to the car
and now the judge is telling me that i had gone too far
and now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
and since i gone to a cell for some petty crimes
i guess i gone to the well one too many times 'cause i'm gone

kanye west
i'm ahead of my time sometimes years out
so the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
and that make me wanna get my advance out

from a shady place where babies blaze trees on a daily day
tryna get they gravy straight to floss 'cause told me homey watch it
these ladies play dirty games with you get to grindin
where niggas pitch as quick as nolan ryan
holdin' iron blowin' smoke elope in fire flame spittin'
the game is just a way to escape
and our pain is just a way we can relate to folks cryin
findin ways i can make a difference
but fuck wishin on a star 'cause the percentage of gettin' what you envisioned is small
and the stars barely shine in the city so we're blinded
by the manmade bright lights makin' my eyes shifty
feel me out hear me now cryin childs of the ghetto
lettin go a beautiful sound it's kinda falsetto
hello hell welcome to la where devils that dwell play
they meddle with metal and lettin every shell spray
until day dawns i make songs for the long road travelers
and lost souls after us
spittin' lyrics vicious like i'm mad as fuck
packin up my bags hoppin back on the narrow path that's planned for us'

tryna' tell my folks that flowin' ain't easy
travellin' down this yellow brick road until it frees me
i need a pen i need a pad i need a place to go
to get this shit lifted offa my soul

in this world that i'm livin' in
i've given into sex stress and dividends
los angeles metropolis city of vexed citizens
folks that smoke infinite dope for hope living in
poverty is probably the less stress position to go
so we don't have positions to hold
so we pitch snow and live in the cold in hell
in hell felling heaven is close
but like road kill i'm still on this road
bold as any soilder playing his role
i stroll the steets in the cold
even in the summer heat it gets cold
so we stroll with the heat and its cold
it's beeen a long troublesome road and i'm still travelin
fuck battling just managing life is challenging
though i managed to make it
i damaged the place up in my mind
like the times of los angles greatest
wasting time and lifespans fucking around
i'm spitting deep shit stuck in the ground
so just dig it or don't fuck with it
cause you can't fuck with it

tryna' tell my folks that flowin' ain't easy
travellin' down this yellow brick road until it frees me
i need a pen i need a pad i need a place to go
to get this shit lifted offa my soul

check it
and i'll be playin' escapism by pete rock
hot watchin police plot knocks to get my peeps locked
smilin' as my teeth rot
from eatin sugar coated quotes smokin' dope to float away
but hey the air is nice up there
i swear the feelin's good as chillin' with a nice cold beer
we fallen angels rockin' halo's like its priced up gear
and if you need me just ring me shit i'll be right up here
where fear is non-existent
instead of driftin' in a prison where my minds restricted
where my mind is wishin' while tryin' to get a broken promise mended
i'm trainin to be a seamstress sewin holes that dreams fit ?
fiends bling broken clocks tryna get their dreams fixed ?
tickin itchin tockin' watchin god is watching you
but you rather have a watch with lots of diamonds i've been fooled
by the word a few times who cares is blu rhymes
about ho's or savin' souls they wanna hear that beat ride
i rewind and try to play back the days that they would play stacks
and 8-tracks to recline now we blaze sacks
takin' back the feelin' hidden in me when we used to smile remember that?
it's been a while so i'm blowin' off the dust
brushin dirt up off my nutts got this feelin' in my gut
i'm tryna let it out so if you with me then listen up listen
listen up cause uh i got this feelin' in my gut

rain fallin' callin' x but my phone line's dead
i guess my bills ain't paid no ride to work for the day
second option hop the bus but there's a traffic delay
my boss trippin' 'cause i'm runnin' late and ain't no excuse
when i'm about to be 22 without a whip i could swoop
feel like i'm finna shoot my own dome with chrome to escape
zonin' out 'cause working-working out ain't worth what i make
my lady callin' buggin' always fussin'
just because we ain't ballin'
but it's hard because her cousin's fuckin' rich
'cause her husband's hustlin'
and i ain't fuckin' touchin' nothin' but a mic
five o'clock and off the work ready to go home and write
but i ain't got a buck to catch the bus chillin' at the stop
rain fallin' hard as ever and it's soakin' my socks
fuck it kicked my kicks off and took off my jacket
rolled my jeans up beat up and my headphones blastin'
blazed some weed up and started laughin'
while i'm splashin' in puddles
like mothafuck a struggle we dancing in the rain

don't nobody wanna dance slow in the rain
just move your ass just move your ass
don't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain
just move your ass just move your ass

sometimes i hate taking trips to the lab
got my pen and pad bookin' instrumentals in smash
catch the bus regardless trying hard to be an artist
but my a&ampr be callin' me out my zone into his office
being cautious 'cause he don't want my record to brick
asking me how he think my projects progressin' and shit
i said cool but the truth is i'm stressin' to grip
'cause it's hard to make music when this depression exists
they say use it as inspiration the best of them did
well that's them see i can't handle this pressure for shit
and if you ask me stress is a bitch
my girl needs more attention
and my record label's desperate for hits
now i'm pissed 'cause i'm getting out the zone again
makes me start to dread when i see a microphone and shit
it ain't supposed to be like that i said i'll be right back
i left the office got a phone and called my partner jac
and i asked him remind me why i'm rappin'
and right before he answered i remembered my passion
in the past when i was scribblin' in my tablet
to box out my mom and dad scrappin'
to help me when my grandmother passed
plus the many times when i was homeless
and the times when i was broke
and the music made a way when i was hopeless
he told me to remember the rain it'll diminish the pain
and he told me not to ask him again 'cause i know

don't nobody wanna dance slow in the rain
just move your ass just move your ass
don't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain
just move your ass just move your ass
don't nobody wanna dance slow in the rain
just move your ass just move your ass
don't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain
just move your ass just move your ass

don't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain
just move your ass just move your ass
don't nobody wanna
don't nobody wanna
don't nobody wanna
dance - slow - in the - rain
don't nobody wanna
don't nobody wanna

don't nobody wanna dance slow in the rain
just move your ass just move your ass
don't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain

don't want to mess it up before it's too late

ayo tell me what i'm s'pose to do

you gotta tell me what i'm s'pose to do
let me know just what i'm s'pose to do
first things first
my name is and you are?
i'd like to get to know you if it's okay

see it's so many ways i acn approach you
i can either start off like scuse me miss' but shit that's too old school
and i can flow to you but that's too cliche
plus i don't bust to bust nuts i bust over beat breaks
i could be honest with you and tell you i'm a cheapskate
but you probably seen me sharing drinks with my deejay
so fronting like i got chips is out the question
and acting like my benz is in the shop is outdated
and i ain't into playing games
plus i already hate them fake ballers that be always dropping names
and yeah i'm in the game but if i say i rap
you'll be looking for my range gold chains and my strap
and i can act conscious but if we talk politics
you'll notice that i'm out of the loop 'cause i don't follow it
i rock fitted caps cufies ain't for blu see
i eat red meat cause tofu don't move me
and women are confusing but that's for later on
and the only way to tell you is to say it in a song
like darling you a doll don't confuse it with sexual
but don't think i don't think of having sex with you
i'm trying to get next to you but you being rude
in the club with ya guns out shooting down fools
she shot down one and shot down two
now tell me what the fuck am i suppose to do

ain't tryna game you up so girl i'll be straight
first things first
don't want to mess it up before it's too late

you gotta tell me what i'm s'pose to do
let me know just what i'm s'pose to do
first things first
my name is and you are?
i'd like to get to know you if it's okay

now don't get it twisted broke niggas need love too
and underground rappers like to chill at the club too
i wanna get buzzed bet drunk and get crunk
get a chick to kick it with when i'm feeling fucked up but
women be mentioning ya' whips and your chains
so i flip it like slaves come with whips and chains we gotta liberate
but before i could mention my name
they be talking to the nigga with the keys to the range
and i can't even compete with these ballers trying to get at you
'cause i ain't even got enough cheese to try to match dude
nor do i got a flat to bring you back to
but i can roll up a blunt and try to relax you
probably make you laugh when you mad in a bad mood
and ask a few questions 'bout caressing your statue
cause no i ain't got corn rolls or hood tatoes
but i can fuck up any track that i rap too
i know it's irrelevant but rap is my profession
and just 'cause i'm a gentleman don't mean i'm into settling
i spend most my time on the grind but i ain't peddling rocks
or trying to sign to the rock i'm trying to meddle in my own business
so tell your girls mind they own business
and i would give you my digits but see my phone isn't
excepting calls to the bills get paid
now you say you want the real but it's the real i'm saying so what the deal

ain't tryna game you up so girl i'll be straight
first things first
don't want to mess it up before it's too late

life is cold
cold is pain
pain is growth
and every seed that grows sees rain
and the rain gon' come it ain't nothing new
but when its done the sun shining through


i was cold hearted and young a dumb kid with a gun
cause fun days don't last the last nigga to laugh
so rap fell on my tongue numb feelings remain
and pain comes and it goes
but my wounds shows the room where my pops beat my moms
moms screamin' for help myself hot as a sun
cold hearted and young a dumb kid with a gun
that i got from my pops top drawer
when he left my momma twice in a week
my momma lifeless and weak spendin' her nights in the sheets
with seed killer number one
seed killer number two
seed killer number three
got heat from the newborns scorned brother
blu black hearted and young
raps fell off his tongue
numb feelings remain
the pain comes and it goes
but my wounds show the tomb that now shelters my boy
my boy needed my help myself not in the game
the game heartless and young
dumb niggas with guns cause fun days don't last
the last nigga that blast got shots all in his back
wrath fell on his soul but in my soul he remains
pain comes and it goes
but my wounds show the moon shining off of his blood
his blood ran through his moms
his moms ran outside
5 niggas with guns
seed killer number one
seed killer number two
seed killer number three
pulled the heat and he was through
threw dirt on his casket his mom wore a mask it
still couldn't hide tears years pass her son
numb feelings remain
pain comes and it goes
but my wounds show the groom that still married my mom
my mom still had a son
dumb kid with a gun that i got from my pops
top drawer when he left
my momma fightin' for years
my momma fightin' her tears
now she gotta explain the game of her life to her son
but the sun still shines
nine children and a newborn scorn brother two
blu life isn't young
dumb kid with a tongue that i got from hip hop
but she left me for you so i'm a give her to you

niggas so hollow that they echo like sentiments

nowadays rap artists coming halfhearted
commercial like pop or underground like black markets
where were you when hip hop died?
is it too early to mourn? is it too late to ride?

kwa is chillin' tone is chillin'
what more can i say we stay building

take children through the wilderness by the hand
it's a great feeling show 'em how to be a man

get a collection of all the music and everything we've ever done

woman singing
bringing back sweet memories

bringing back sweet memories

life living in flatbush and going to house parties
red lights bumping life is what you make it then sorry
in my lifetime ain't done too many things
better than watching your first son put his sentences together
yo it kinda make me think of way back when
i was the portrait of the artist as a young man
all them teenage dreams of rapping
writing rhymes on napkins
was really visualization
making this shit actually happen
it's like something come through me
that truly just consume me
speaking through the voices of the spirits speaking to me
i think back in the day i absorbed everything like a sponge
took a plunge into my past to share with my son

bringing back sweet memories
bringing back sweet memories
bringing back sweet memories

like thoughts out the back of my mind
going back in some time
like when you used to cut and had to go to the back of the line
look back and you find
tracks that make you relax and recline
now cats rap about packing a nine
when they lacking divine
inspiration
running out of topics of conversation
well i drop it in the pocket because rocking's my occupation
i do it remarkably spark up a leaf
and possibly you could follow me
tap into your chi
utilize your memory
to help you see clearly then get back to me
actually nothing's new under the sun
so when life be stressing me
my remedy is 'bringing back sweet memories'
like the faces that are woven in the fabric of my consciousness
&gtfrom cities where making 21's a big accomplishment
like when my people understood their prominence
and my past life visions of the continent
like the first time i saw krs live rockin' it
i heard resurrection by common sense
dominant in my psyche
i chose my direction like spike lee
to speak my life through mics and i never take it lightly
it might be something you did to bring you down when you were high
but that karma's a bitch you steady asking god why
like when my parents first split up
yo i was illin'
seems like some years they was together for the sake of the children
and i love them for that
i don't know if they saw that
so i'ma say it and convey it when the world play it 3x

bringing back sweet memories
bringing back sweet memories
bringing back sweet memories

like black is beautiful names from the seventies
let me tap into your energy
fields of dreams become my property
when i reach my destiny like a prophecy
especially when i 'm 'bringing back sweet memories'
i got deep into my mind see i got a treasury
that float through my head like a sweet melody
what you telling me
reflection is a collection of memories
definitely this is how hiphop was meant to be
eventually i knew i'd run into hi-technology
it was only a matter of time like centuries
check the recipe or technique to how it sound so sweet
i freak with word power my man speak with beats
if i could make it in new york i figured anywhere i'd make it
came to cincinnati linked with mood and we did sacred
hi-tek beats became my favorite
hussle on the side was the cut
we started to put songs together like 'what'
travelled the world came back to the crib
and hit the motherland
yeah this year we put in work and got some other plans
in fact that's where i'll take the fam
when the reflection joint is done
by the time you hear this i'll be basking in african sun

chasing but they never catch the wagon
like rerunning what's hap'ning
since back when
they had potty issues and snotty tissues we been rockin'
think you poppin' next year nobody will miss you
my thoughts is too advanced for the artists on these labels
they come sweeter than sabal and softer than mashed potatoes
i tried to told you the rhymes run over emcees like land rovers
took 'em back in time like sam kofa sam kofa

we stand over the atlantic looking broad like a man's shoulders
the fire is trapped in a belly ready to pop like canned soda
we outlasting from middle passage
touched down in new york
cincinnatay big ohio status what you thought
money it's classic these bastards try to treat us like cattle
so life has been a constant battle battle
rising above the crabs in the barrel
way too used to living in death's shadow
we stay on point like the best arrow arrow
we hit the target accurate
star shit back it up
when we hit town y'all niggas pack it up
that's how we get down straight smash it up
like a whip hydroplaning
hydro on the brain and maintaining
game changing into subtle shit we remain blatant
yo got to tell you to your face
you get replaced in this game by kweli
place the face with the name
these cats drink champagne and toast to death and pain

the language of love cannot be translated yo

you up in the club feelin' the night life lookin' for the right type
blood rushing to your heart making it beat
when she swept you off your feet and made it complete
you know the plan you had to conquer the world
thinking you scarface looking for that perfect girl
and now you found her
started with romantic then got to frantic
then things that's normally small become gigantic
now y'all sinking like the titanic here come the panic
when i'm with you like a habit without you i can't stand it
it's tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
in the bed can't get a nut off communication cut off
getting mad cause you turned or wondering where she shut off
constantly comparing you to someone in my past
we don't smile anymore and we argue over cash
advance to that physical shit

see what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf

swam in the ocean and saw beneith
how the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral piece
that's what your beauty remind me of
it's hard to find a love like ours taking it high above
them other duns try to spit game but i don't sweat it though
know in my heart that we connected so i let it go

anything but queen i'll go to war like a king
your friends sweat you cause you ain't got a band
but they don't understand
some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
and they hate griffey too so they try to get into it
both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
we speak the love language they speak from pain and anguish
some don't love theyselves so they perception is tainted
out the joint like shit he paying for you and missing the point

originally it was by nina simone
she said it was inspired by down south south east they called her mother antie
you know she said no misses just antie you know what i'm sayin'?
she said if anybody ever called her antie she'd burn the whole god damn place down
but you knowwe're movin' pass thatyou know what i'm sayin'?
comin' into the new millennium we can't forget our elders

i got off the 2 train in brooklyn on my way to a session
said lemme help this woman up the stairs before i get to steppin'
we got into a conversation she said she a hundred and seven
just her presence was a blessin' and her essence was a lesson
she had her head wrapped and long dreads that peeped out the back like an antenna to help her get a sense of where she was at
imagine that living a century the strength of her memories felt like an angel had been sent to me
she lived from nigga to colored to negro to black to afro then african american and rite back to nigga
you'd figure she'd be bitter in the twilight
but she a'ight 'cause she done seen the circle of life
yo her skin is black like its packed with melanin back in the days as slaves she be packin'like harriet tubman/ and
her arms are long and she moves like a song feet with corn hands with calluses but the heart is warm/ and
her hair is wooly it attract alot of energy even negative she gotta dead-that the head-rap is a remedy
her back is strong and she far from a bag of bones this is the back the master's whip used to crack upon
strong enough to take all the pain that's been inflicted again and again and again and again and then flip it
to the love for her children nothin' else matters
what do they call her? they call her a'nt sarah

singing

i know a girl with a name as beautiful as the rain
her face is the same but she suffers an unusual pain
seems she only deal with losers who be using them games
chasin' the real brothers away like she confused in the brain
she try to get in where she fit in on that american dream mission paid tuition filled up a seat to find her history was missin'
and started flippin' seein' the world with very different eyes
people askin' her what she'll do when come time to choose a side/ yo
her skin is yellow just like her face is blonde word is bond and her hair is long and straight just like sleeping beauty
see she truly feel like she belong in two worlds and that she can't relate to other girls
her father was rich and white still living with wife but he forced himself on her mother late one night they call that rape that's rite
and now she take flight through life with hate and spite inside her mind that keep up till the break of light alot of times
i gotta find myself i gotta find myself i gotta find myself she had to remind herself
they call her saphronia the unwanted seed
blood still blue in the vein and red when she bleeds

a daughter come up in georgia ripe and ready to plant seeds
left the plantation when she saw a sign even though she can't read
it came from god right when life get hard she always speak to him
she'd rather kill her babies than let the master get to 'em
she on the run up north to get across the macy dickson
in church she learned how to be patient and keep wishin'
the promise of eternal life after death for those that god bless
she swear the next baby she have would breathe a freed breath
and get milk from her freed breast and love being alive
otherwise they would have to give up being themselves to survive
being maids cleaning ladies maybe teachers college graduates nurses or house wifes prostitutes and drug addicts
some will grow to be old women some will die before they born
they'll be mothers and lovers who inspire and make songs/ but me?
my skin it brown and my manner is tough
like the love i give my babies when the rain was enough
i kill the first muthafucka to mess with me i never bluff
i ain't got time to lie my life has been much too rough
still runnin' with barefeet i ain't got nothin' but my sole
freedom is the ultimate goal
life and death are small inna hole in many ways i've often been in these days
cause the only parents god gave me they were slaves/ and it crippled me
i got the destiny of a casualty
but i live though my babies and change my reality

i never had to pack my lines with plastic rhymes
diamond in the rough give it time you'll find your light and shine

be easy i could three hit 'em right where his shoulder sit
maneuver throught the swamp like a four-wheeler

that juggy shit is over the war is on
i ony want to be a soldier i'm holding on to a culture
focused like gordon parks when it's sorta dark
for niggas that's flooded with ice my thought's the ark
performing warming arts with some shit for the heart
don't fuck with radio ignoring the charts
i could give a fuck what you made in a year nigga you wack
a soft nigga on a hard track in this new rap
generation i x cats like a muslim
he fell off 'cause i pushed him
let his bently and his weak crew be his cushion
i catch him on the streets in front of the bodyguards and rush him

doin' it doin' it i am doin' it
c o double m o to the n cut and scratched 4x

you wasn't saying you was a thug before pac came
ten years ago you had a high top trying to be like kane
then snoop released and it became a g thang
claim sets your city ain't got gangs
niggas hate you they ain't paying you no attention
in a circle of faggots your name is mentioned
with six degrees i separate mc's from a business man that's good
from a nigga that was raised or just lived in the hood
from what a nigga says to what's understood
keep my shit tight like them boys in the wood
dick is always hard like the boyz in the hood
peace to dug inf no i sean lett the whole chi
at the crib some cats give me the cold eye
i'm a bitch slap the next one
let him know the world is my section for taking
you got to reduce aggression

gotta be somethin for me to write this
queen i ain't seen you in a minute
wrote this letter and finally decide to send it
signed sealed delivered - for us to grow together
love has no limit let's spend it slow forever
i know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
i ain't gon assault em cause i probably did it too
because of you feelin's i handle with care
some niggaz recognize the light but they can handle the glare
you know i ain't the type to walk around with matching shirts
if relationship is effort i will match your work
i wanna be the one to make you happiest it hurts you the most
they say the end is near it's important that we close
to the most high
regardless of what happen
on him let's rely

there are times when you'll need someone
i will be by your side
there is a light that shines
special for you and me

yo yo check it
it's important we communicate
and tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
i never call you my bitch or even my boo
there's so much in a name and so much more in you
few understand the union of woman and man
where sex and a tingle is where they assumin it land
but that's fly by night for you and the sky i write
for in these cold chi night's moon you my light
if heaven had a height you would be that tall
ghetto to coffee shop through i see that all
let's stick to understandin and we won't fall
for better or worse times i hope to me you call
so i pray everyday more than anything
friends will stay as we begin to lay
this foundation for a family - love ain't simple
why can't it be anythin worth havin you work at annually?
granted we known each other for some time
it don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

there are times when you'll need someone
i will be by your side oh darlin
there is a light that shines
special for you and me

yeah yo yo check it
it's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
and i can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
plus you ship hop when it's time to thinkin you fresh
suggestin beats i should rhyme to
at times when i'm lost i try to find you
you know to give me space when it's time to
my heart's dictionary defines you it's love and happiness
truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence
the time we committed love it was real good
had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
i know the sex ain't gon keep you but as my equal
it's how i must treat you
as my reflection in light i'ma lead you
and whatever's right i'ma feed you
digga-da digga-da digga-da digga-digga-d-da
yo i tell you the rest when i see you peace

there are times when you'll need someone
i will be by your side oh

the perseverance of a rebel i drop heavier levels
it's unseen or heard a king with words
can't knock the hustle but i've seen street dreams deferred
dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
some say i'm too deep i'm in too deep to sleep
through me muhammad will forever speak
greet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes
where a man is determined by how much a man make
cop cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
with cigarettes in their ear niggerish they appear
under the fubu is a guru that's untapped
want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
you tripping with nowhere to unpack forgot that

i'm the truth across the table from corporate lies
immortalized by the realness i bring to it
if revolution had a movie i'd be theme music
my music you either fight fuck or dream to it
my life is one big rhyme i try to scheme through it
through my shell never knew what the divine would bring to it
i'd be lying if i said i didn't want millions
more than money saved i want to save children
dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
a complex man drawn off of simplicity
reality is frisking me
this industry will make you lose intensity
the common sense in me remembers the basement

how many dead folks this art resurrected
how many nations this culture connected
who am i to judge one's perspective
though some of that shit y'all pop to it i ain't relating
if i don't like it i don't like it that don't mean that i'm hating
i just want to innovate and stimulate minds
travel the world and penetrate the times
escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
raps are smoke signals letting the streets know i'm with 'em

in the spirit of the ancestors
in the spirit of the black panthers
in the spirit of assata shakur
we make this movement towards freedom
for all those who have been oppressed
and all those in the struggle
yeah yo check it

there were lights and sirens gunshots firin'
cover your eyes as i describe a scene so violent
seemed like a bad dream she laid in a blood puddle
blood bubbled in her chest cold air brushed against open flesh

no room to rest pain consumed each breath
shot twice with her hands up
police questioned but shot before she answered

one panther lost his life the other ran for his
scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
comprehension she was beyond tryna hold on
to life she thought she'd live with no arm

that's what it felt like got to the hospital eyes held tight
they moved her room to room-she could tell by the light
handcuffed tight to the bed through her skin it bit
put guns to her head every word she got hit

who shot the trooper? they asked her
put mace in her eyes threatened to blast her
her mind raced till things got still
opened her eyes realized she's next to her best friend who got killed

she got chills they told her that's where she would be next
hurt mixed wit anger survival was a reflex
they lied and denied visits from her lawyer
but she was buildin' as they tried to destroy her

if it wasn't for this german nurse they woulda served her worse
i read this sister's story knew that it deserved a verse
i wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
all this shit so we could be free so dig it y'all

i'm thinkin' of assata yes
listen to my love assata yes
your power and pride is beautiful
may god bless your soul

it seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
walkie-talkies cracklin i see 'em when they takin' her
though she kinda knew
what made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue

arrived to middlesex prison about six inna morning
uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in a cell
one cot no window facing hell
put in the basement of a prison wit all males
and the smell of misery seatless toilets and centipedes
she'd exercise paint and begin to read
two years inna hole her soul grew weak
away from people so long she forgot how to speak

she discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
and a wall is a wall and can be broken down
found peace in the panthers she went on trial with
one of the brothers she had a child with

the foulness they would feed her hopin' she's lose her seed
held tight knowing the fight would live through this seed
in need of a doctor from her stomach she'd bleed
out of this situation a girl was conceived

separated from her left to mother the revolution
and lactated to attack hate
'cause federal and state was built for a black fate
her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates

they fabricated cases hoping one would stick
and said she robbed places that didn't exist
in the midst of threats on her life and being caged with aryan whites
through dark halls of hate she carried the light

i wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
all of this shit so we could be free
yeah i often wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
all of this shit so we could be free so dig it people

i'm thinkin' of assata yeah
listen to my love assata yeah
your power and pride so beautiful
may god bless your soul ooh

yo
from north carolina her grandmother would bring
news that she had had a dream
her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
what made them real was the action in between

she dreamt that assata was free in they old house in queens
the fact that they always came true was the thing
assata had been convicted of a murder she couldnta done
medical evidence shown she couldna shot the gun

it's time for her to see the sun from the other side
time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
time for this beautiful woman to become soft again
time for her to breathe and not be told how or when

she untangled the chains and escaped the pain
how she broke out of prison i could never explain
and even to this day they try to get to her
but she's free with political asylum in cuba

i'm thinkin' of assata yeah
listen to my love assata yeah
we're molded from the same mud assata
we share the same blood assata yeah

your power and pride so beautiful
may god bless your soul
your power and pride so beautiful
may god bless your soul ooh

freedom you askin me about freedom?
askin me about freedom?
i'll be honest with you
i know a whole lot more about what freedom isn't than about what it is
'cause i've never been free
i can only share my vision with you of the future about what freedom is
uhh the way i see it uh-
freedom is-- is the right to grow is the right to blossom
freedom is -is the right to be yourself to be who you are
to be who you wanna be to do what you wanna do",3

y'all waited too long for this x4

masta ace

aiyyo it's been a long time just like sweet revenge
never thought that i'd be seen on these streets again
it's been five years at least
waiting for a piece
bouncing off of these walls awaiting my release
pacing like a caged lion
with rage prying
all them days trying to engage with the iron
stuck in between a rock and a hard place
i got down on my knees looked into god's face
its really not the same is it?
with low digits
and y'all ain't hold me down ain't paid me no visits
new cats claiming shit like they bought stock
and y'all let 'em move in and take over the block
i heard y'all be out there spending dubs with 'em
out all night long going to clubs with 'em
i guess that's what i get for having a kind heart
today's when they life end and mine starts

apocalypse
sometimes waking up is even kinda scary
some foul deeds i find necessary
like the christ and the judas theory
i feel the hurt and scream loud but nobody hears me
my broken body bleeds heavy plus my mind is weary
slipped the mickey when they first gave me sex
addicted to the trees henneseys and cigarettes
inhaling the toxic gases when i breath
study words of higher deity cause him i believe
i don't pray on my knees
just in case the evils comes like d's
i'll be ready to blast and make him bleed
in high double-digits i go back to the essence
leave my rhymes behind so you can use 'em for lessons
like a new revelations chapter
you ain't moving slow it's just that in my mind i'm moving faster
sick messiah like i'm david koresh
you done picked the wrong nigga to test
now pick - the trey pound or the tech

y'all waited too long for this x 5

gun shots",3
2,"masta ace
woke up this morning hearing shots below my project window
the tv's on from playing all night on nintendo
jumped out of bed tryin' to see what's up with all the noise and
i see somebody else has caught a case of lead poison
this type of shit around my way is a regular occurrence
because the same shit just happened to my nigga terrence
a week later now somebody else is laying dying
surrounded by a crowd of people and his momma crying
the way he's laying there it looks to me that he's a goner
i seen the cats who just did it run around the corner
i start to wonder who it is and why they had to wet him
i bet i knew him or at least i bet i probably met him
i can't pretend that i'm shocked like electrocution
'cause any night there could be an execution
my momma told me that that thug shit will get you buried
the next day there's your name in the obituary
i asked her why we gotta live in this environment
she said your grandfather drank up his retirement
plus when i fucked around and had you i was just a baby
just maybe if i wasn't being miss lady
things could've been a little bit better
threw on my jeans and my double knit sweater
i hit the block tryin' to find out who got done in
who had the gun and who that was i seen running

another body on the ground cold and
another day another lost soul and
same shit in every zip code
no matter where you go
its just another block episode
another story on the street told and
another turn down the wrong road and
sit back and watch it unfold
yo i'll let you know
just another block episode

punchline
yo i roam the streets with my peeps and the gun by my crotch
i got beef with this cat that resides on my block
he getting popped i swear when i see him it's on
he'll just be a tattoo on his best friends arm
my friends screaming punch be calm y'all can save it
he borrowed 5 g's two months ago still ain't pay it
this girl hit me on the cell about his location
i grabbed my gun jumped in the hoopty then i started racing
turned off the lights a block away so he don't peep the caper
i see him and a bunch of cats by the bodega
don't wanna kill him i just wanna teach this cat a lesson
stepped on the gas grab the gun cocked back the weapon
shot up the whole corner but hit him in the kneecap
that's cool 'cause dead niggaz can't pay your cash back
i'm nuttin' to laugh at i keep bad temper
i hit him a bystander and one of his crewmembers
gunshot

wordsworth
yo yo yo yo last thing i heard was a blast car circling past
i wasn't nervous thought they might be searching for gas
soon as rob came out dispersing the trash
car sped and lead went through his windows curtains and glass
dove in the dirt and the grass
i look bullet struck my right arm
glass in my left palm i lost my neck charm
i knew it was punch 'cause rob owed him money
but never had it always got new kicks and gear to match it
i'm in the ambulance i thought that beef was squashed
that's why when he seen punch he crossed the street and dodged
see rob's records with the da and ???
my records 40 gpa going to harvard
athletes 100 miles and running he's a convict
other hand my high school football team i lead in yardage
boys regardless blood pressure dropped artery vessel clogged
cardiac arrest next my chest was shocked iv
oxygen mask bleeding heavily
we need to get to the hospital fast i'm doing 70
why i gotta be a casuality of war did good most my life
my career was growing gradually and more

i was all up in the mix with one of your friends
and when you seen us you would always give me one of your grins
like if i only knew what i was missin'
i would quit kissing on this chick and change my position
i really thought you and my man was a better match
i never thought you was the type that i could catch
i used to see you out in the park with different cats
them big willie types that rocked them pimp hats
had every other guy on the block trying to get you
wishing that they had that rap to get with you
felt you was out of my league
it's like if you was silk and linen then i was fatigue
i never would have pictured you and me together
but it's like the way i hold you we was meant to be together

now i spend most of my time just being with you
early on i was afraid to be seen with you
'cause i knew cats would do anything they could
to stop us from being together it's all good
they was mad 'cause i got you and they didn't
some even tried to approach me i'm not kidding
had to be ten times i got into a fight
with niggas tried to say i wasn't hitting it right -
they kept on hating just kept on waiting
hoping that we'd break up but we kept dating
never knew it would be so hard to be with you
i should make it easy on my self and just quit you

make it easy on myself [x2]
i need to make it easy on my self
yup i need to make it easy on my self
yup i need to make it easy on my self

and ya might see ya neighbor down at the corner bodega

from versace to a cool-g sweater and a matchin' hat
see this cats got a big bag of stuff that he just stole
it's the same old routine but it never gets old
and ya might catch a cab if you live on the right block
from black pearl to white top yo they might stop

but the driver got a bigger one up under the seat

i'ma fuck like it's my honeymoon till i touch sixty
you ain't a thug so don't try to get tough with me
if you think about tryna hit me you'll get snuffed quickly
deep down hate bobby brown but love whitney
at times i wish it was oj and the glove fit me
then i wouldn't have to hear none of you wack niggas
talk about how your crew's rich and you stack figures
in my hand's a chrome gun with a black trigger
i know you think your shit's big but i pack bigger
just ask your wife 'cause i blasted her pipes
if i tell strick to pass me a knife would you ask for your life?
you's a pussy i can tell by your song
homo/thug rapper i can tell by your thong

i'm about to take this beat and teach you 'bout the agony of defeat
in this football game in the street
and no it ain't two hand touch it's rough tackle
when niggas ball on your block and they buss at you
the fields' fill of players and they all tryin' to score
the whole team sits on the bench in the down pour
'cause no matter the weather the game don't stop
competin with other teams that reign on top
your offense gotta be cats with no conscious
no nonsense niggas with no options
that know how to carry that rock
make the hand-off and run off the block
it's hard to get first down when your new in this rough town
you sell a pound it's a touchdown
and niggas see the pigskin? they blast cops
some federal agents dressed as mascots
niggas hold weight but it's not for liftin'
the only white lines is the ones niggas sniffin'
i know it sounds a bit different the only quarter is a quarter key
if that ain't a penalty it oughta be
and the concession stand is so sick
servin' you the cat rat and dog on a stick
but if you ask why somebody got slain
yo it's just an unfriendly game

chorus masta ace strick announcer
the game don't stop cats keep playin'
some got hit hard and wound up layin'
out in the field but the fans keep payin'
understand what i'm sayin'?
it's just an unfriendly game
this ain't america is it?
this ain't america is it? where can i be

yo aiyyo it's monday night we on some watch the game shit
but i can go outside and still see the same shit
'cause look there's a bunch of niggas in a huddle look
looks like they callin' the play come in kids don't be all in the way
'cause that's pookie he the fuckin' quarterback
'cause he like to use the shotgun if he don't i know he got one
and that's budda he the fuckin' runnin' back
'cause he always say he gon' quit and he always wind up runnin' back
the rest of them? i'll just say they play the line
'cause they like to protect pookie and pookie make them stay in line
and if they make a wrong move they penalized
not by the referee but by pookie brother jeffery
and jeff don't touch shit he sit and watch yup
oversees the whole block from his own private luxury box
he's the one that makes the deals happen
smokin' big cigars while his stars are in the field scrappin'
but tonight the line of scrimmage got penetrated
the block got raided and everybody got traded
now they wearin' stripes in a pen guess that's how the game go
nigga you don't know? highlights at 10

wednesday police arrested 12 men in a downtown drug raid

there's a new team in from outta town

so you won't make a sack of money
and every now and then somebody drops the ball
and the next team be right there to take it all
now somebody new is tryin' to make a score in your territory
it's the same old story
and if you want your corner back you better wear a vest
just in case you gotta pull at bullet to the chest

taking shots fo crown 'cause i'm going through things

i'm trying to school these young niggaz it ain't all what it seems
i still struggle just like you and i still hustle just like you
but it just so happens that big pooh doing what he love to do
get back on my work 'cause i was penning on this piece last night
that'll drive these niggaz berserk
tiggalo hit me up pooh its time to murk
throw on a pair of sweats a-1's white shirt
headed back to the shop back to the spot where the hits keep coming
stack them up like bricks you can call me the mason of shit
foundation has been rock solid no replacing ya dig?
no replacing my nig on everything that i live
we gonna let this bitch ride to our trains collide
or we fall off track and ain't no bringing me back
and everything that go for you the same applies to pat

it looks like a beautiful morning

each day's another chance to do the things i could've
done the day before but i didn't and i known i should've
so i say a prayer for the gone for gooders
who left this world then kiss my girl good mornin' shuga
another sunrise and as much as i would love
to roll over on you i cannot do it because
the good lord i prayed to him
and he said niggaz is listening now
so i better have something to say to 'em
so i'mma tell 'em how it went down man
doin' shows for free goin' outta town man
the way i almost broke down and got a 9 to 5
'cause i had more press than the soundscans
this is the price that i pay for this music
and every word that i write is a testament to it
and if i had to go back i wouldn't change a thing
wouldn't re-cut it re-edit or change a frame
'cause it would not be fair to turn my back on the struggle
when that exact same hustle got me here
told niggaz for the getup we three the hard way
and broadway's the only place you'll ever throw a set up
speechless is all you'd be if we ever met up
i survived far to much now to ever let up motherfucker

i went from niggaz tellin' me i really shouldn't rhyme
to droppin' a classic album muhfuckers couldn't find
took my respect took lessons and took the time

'cause i write so tight within the moment
and spit like my life depended on it
i target you herbs
on some teleprompter shit i got you watching your words

taxin' these like no dependents
12 bar courtroom drama with no co-defendants
don't beat it off come to your senses

it all started back in '99 when time was hard
north carolina central but we called it the yard
'cause niggaz wasn't trying to study abroad
they was trynna study a broad or two ir three up in the dorms
met my nigga chaundon and i started to ponder
fuck this i'mma quit the football team tomorrow
did shows around town and word got around that battling tay
was like yelling 'spic' in tijuana
build my rep up that's when pooh and 9th stepped up
9th was old school pooh was young and playing catch-up
cool 'cause he could still rock an instrumental
our first joints yeah they was wack
but niggaz could hear potential in 'em
honing our skills for survival hustling
our flyers passed out like mamma at revival
the real deal on how i repped my peeps
you ain't goin' find this in no press release

hook extended

dealin' with their managers and program directors
and even though i try not to stress it
sometimes it feels like a waste of time and not worth the effort

naw but i won't let it
put a block on my team's hustle for a second
poobie keep it rushing as long as tay and i on the mic
and 9th is on the percussion these fronting dudes can't say nothing
it was only time for we finally spoke out
plenty cold nights ahead i suggest you get your coats out
no time to stand here lips poked out we bout to closeout that stored up doubt
and keep it moving


seems like whatever i do
it's not enough for you
i paid the cost and gave you my all
but you still want more
i'm still standing right here
but it seems so unfair
that i sacrifice and give you my life
but you still want more

so much to discuss so frustrated
yes i must say that the industry lost touch
radio better play this 'cause tay's style is nuts

when i write its for all of nc call me the state pen
and now i'm making my name for those who hate that i'm
staking my claim just like nationwide

took our wax to the station and they straight played us
that's how the game got contaminated
and now they sayin' we're at fault like the san andreas

but not spin the record or disc
i got a fire burning deep that will not be extinguished
i mean this from the depths of my soul
people no more mind talk let my heart take control oh

- uh right now we gettin' it right now and now we gonna give you what you want
- just listen to this just listen to this

another little brother presentation
sending this out across the nation

i'm a hell of a problem nobody has the answer
pooh be spreading out like a body of cancer
my stanza get it going like a car vroom
usher in the new era like this y'all this y'all
i'm raw strip down no minerals
a distilled emcee no chemicals
no subliminals
a smooth criminal before the rape charge
i shake and bake bring terror to your squad
my peers ferocious
i'm so focusing
i pray to god that the world knows this
no one exposes flaws in your scheme dog
me and dilla go hard my lord
you don't want know problems problems
i'm a nigga that'll solve 'em solve 'em
without a doubt ya
i'm in the booth cold knockin' niggaz out
tell my tales by word of mouth
ya you know me

where you gonna hide?
when the sun goes down and the lights in the city get low
where you gonna hide?
when your peeps ain't around and there ain't no place to go
where you gonna hide?
when the hood starts watchin and the boys got they eye on your safe
where you gonna hide?
ain't nowhere to run and there ain't no hiding place

don't compare me to jokes
i'll strangle the air in your throat
like you jump from a chair and choke
in mid-air from a rope
got a big gun and carry a scope
the flair of the smoke
keep niggaz quiet like words that librarians spoke
i'm arrogant outlandish
blow your face out and shake out the dandruff
the jakes wont make out the handprints
i'm as real as it gets with the steel and the clips
bark and make niggaz duck and kneel and do splits

it gets no realer than this
its tay and elzhi dropping that definitive shit
this should have been a double album commemorative disc
cause hip-hop might need us
and in your town no telling where you might see us
my whole team coming through in tees and wife beaters
out doin' their damn thing like beavers
yo its p to the h-o i finish the job
plus my dominican broad
making me chili con queso

work and plan a perfect verse
then burst like a person
that jerked from a circus cannon
then landed to the earth
it's me on the song featured your fleet
breathing is strong
it's a gypsy reading a palm
with a drawn heater
never gone of the wrong reefer
a bong chief of the don ballest
as long as the bronze is bronze sneakers
got ways of a thuggie thinking i won't come and get you
dressed like a gun with pistols and ak's in a bundle

and tay is blazing it lovely 'cause i'm one with the game
so i sat back chilled dropped foreign exchange
and a lot of rap niggaz got lost
heard phontigga carrying tunes and assumed he don got soft
they didn't understand it was my next direction
so i'm playing postman and addressing questions
like yes i'm still a lb no i'm not leaving
no i don't eat meat but yes i'm still beefin
but all these wack niggaz putting records out
this is all live nigga check it out
lb s bill a fam on a mission
and i ain't worried about people biting minstrel show
they still teething on the listening

where you gonna hide?
when the sun goes down and the lights in the city get low
where you gonna hide?
when your peeps ain't around and there ain't no place to go
where you gonna hide?
when the hood starts watchin and the boys got they eyes on your safe
where you gonna hide?
ain't nowhere to run and there ain't no hiding place",3

rapper big pooh
i'm trying to man up see what's really good with you
gentleman's approach not bring it hood to you
same things that you hear everyday like
hey ma hey boo baby what's your name
please pull up a seat i'm so glad you came
my mother call me thomas you can do the same
damn it's so refreshing when you calling out my name
been pooh for so long it doesn't sound the same
my occupation rap and i make a little change
i see you not impressed with what this life brings
finished school got a job girl do your thing
it's a lot of independent women wanna be claimed
marry into money or marry into fame or at least give birth to a check
with all due respect lets two-step in the name of like
who says we gotta do the waltz all day and all night it's like

if love is not enough
we don't have to rush
come around i'll slow it down just you
lady you should be
right here next to me
come around i'll slow it down just for you

rapper big pooh
we can go to the movies
i'll take you to the park and promise to have you home before the lights go out
steady asking you questions what your life about
oh and me mine's everything i scribe about
no doubt this my life and
dedicated to this witting sacrificing everything for it
wasted time i can't afford
so if it ain't you/then you know i'm cooped up to the record

phonte
i'll scoop you up in me porshe sike
you know i got a nissan
that i'm still paying for still got a lease on
but it don't matter 'cause that ain't my aim to get you
i got fame but you know that just ain't the issue
because you're looking like a woman of virtue
so well-rounded no wonder your're in my circle
and normally you probably wouldn't give me the time of day
'cause tay got rhymes but no he ain't got time to waste

phonte
sometimes i think i'm from another world preach
when i'm trynna tell a woman just exactly where i stand that aight
i want a girl when i want a girl
and when i don't want a girl i want a girl who understands that
and that's some hard shit to explain
to a woman that's in love with you it's a pitiful thing
until i had to figure
that i don't wanna play around but i don't wanna settle down
and that's a man's dilemma 'cause every man remembers
how his daddy and his uncles did it
'cause more than likely that's the way they're gonna do it
i know it sound fucked up and most wont admit it
but yo i gotta face it 'cause i know i'm living through it
'cause when the party stops and niggaz get old
and the chain and the cars and the houses get sold and that
other side of the bed gets cold you don't wanna be alone
so girl i'm trynna hold you

vamp out
oh baby take it slow take it slow take it slow take it slow
what you need to do is
take it slow with me
slow it down a little bit take it slow take it slow take it slow take it slow
we don't have to rush into anything serious
take it slow take it slow take it slow take it slow
no we don't take it from me take it slow take it slow take it slow take it slow
my name is percy and i make miracles if you take it slow with me baby
take it slow take it slow take it slow take it slow",3

hit up envy every wednesday at the club i'm famous
for buyin' bottles at half price
me and my girls act nice relaxed life dancin' with half pints
kissed many a
mister
wasn't mr right
that's okay sister was lookin' for mr tonight
and he'd called me up a couple times we exchanged a couple lines
and i'd backtrack repeat a couple times
when he hollered hardly wasn't thinkin'
except i'm lookin' fresh like every ex you dream of meetin'
on the humble tumbled down a couple notches into swappin' spit
gave myself and i knew that he was poppin' shit
crumble into the advances
mumblin' he's sorry dancin'
i couldn't stop the attraction wasn't properly actin'
and so i got down and it wasn't nothin'
i kept on like my heart wasn't frontin' but i was hurtin' y'all
you can't believe that somebody that you love that much
would ever bring they hands to you and properly touch
face smack you race back to when he kicked you in the back
muscle relax and strugglin' to erase the facts
only one i thought who really knew me
threw me away truly
how cruelly can love treat you?
i learned a lot
learned how to numb the pain
after the liquor i could split him up out of my brain
i continued on though
dated a couple dudes
one was just lame one broke my bathroom
but all in all it was an ill experience
i threw a couple parties dj i'm serious
cocaine was curious
was not for me though
ended up smokin' more than i sold of the 'dro
i'm spendin' up all of the money i got in the bank
i'm thinkin' maybe i should probably slow down on the drinks
my intake is over levels of panicin' at three out of seven i've spent blackin' out
and no doubt
i don't know how to ration
wakin' up and just feelin' smashed again but can't quit
it's still a love song
it's still a love song

but all the love's wrong
lord is my luck gone?
but just wait the story goes on

i had replaced him
with the last verse's one
we were forsaken
but we're both so much alike alcoholics
tattoos
except that he's brolic
so i called him
up in my apartment
watchin' cartoons
drinkin' old e and we're both stallin'
we need more drinks so we ventured out
to the club liquored up then we vent about
why things never worked and then we started dancin'
he's aplogizin' and i'm entranced and then
for the next two weeks we were inseparable
weed undetectable
drinkin' till inept until
we would wile out
both startin' fights
every club both carried a knife
weapon lovers
we slept together
but check each other whenever it got too much
bonnie and clyde rep whatever
he's my personal calendar
appreciates the rhyme caliber
feasts on diners every night after
dancin'
romancin' is never a problem
we got envy's on valentine's day
it's a coffin
it's a wrap
other niggas are dead
and then all of a sudden his voicemail's in my head
just two weeks of this relationship
i should have known that this beauty would give way to some shit
i called him
from the studio
the way that he flip
and you'd think that he never just have lately kissed
he wanted space started screamin' and i hazily grip
the phone listen as he crazily tip the scales thrown
off the hook man
recorded +love venom+
for mr len's album that night
heart swellin'
i put his number in it
fuck a love i'm finished
tuck in my feelings like a chain and fuck you niggas
it's still a love song
it's still a love song
lord knows i've waited for so long
but all the love's wrong
lord has my luck gone?
just wait the story goes on",3

you're down and out money funny you hustle and die
on the verge of pawnin your jewelry and sellin your ride
somebody shoulda told him ain't no life in these streets
you only out here till you touch it when you touch it you eat
niggaz done took too many chances shovelin snow
and ended up facin a lifetime for tryin' to sco'
i'm givin' livin' definitions on the subject of dope
one week he back on his feet the next he's whoa
i was a 70's baby raised in the 80's
i was barely touchin 16 when shit got crazy
i remember in the 80's me and pop would ride
now we conversate on acres we's about to buy
he had already been what i'm about to go through
told me ain't no sense in gamblin if you gamble to lose
if you made twelve dollars you put seven away
and lived off the five and never ever fuck with ya safe
but when

when he hustle and he robbin
that's when niggaz start plottin
and when you niggaz start plottin
us country niggaz start mobbin - mobbin

scarface
i'm bout my paper these other niggaz slang for the sport
like unaware tomorrow ain't promised the game is too short
i've witnessed niggaz get it all and give it away
gettin' back was out of the question they lived for today
then the hunger pains start up then the murderous plots
to set up they fuckin' homeboy to get what he got
i mean the ones he broke the bread with the ones you don't want
to be the ones fuckin' your girlfriend the moment you out
i know the street game backwards forwards sideways
it used to be an honest hustle back then but nowadays
it's cutthroat that's fucked up niggaz want they come up
so bad they'll take the 357 and smoke they brother
a damn shame but that's the way the game go
a chance niggaz is takin' especially if they slang dope
i've been in that position back in the day
and feel my homey hittin my head to crack in my safe
and that's when

when ya hustle ain't evolvin
that's when niggaz start starvin
and when you niggaz start starvin
that's when you niggaz start robbin when these niggaz start robbin
when these niggaz got problems
that's when niggaz start plottin
and when you niggaz start plottin
us country niggaz start mobbin - mobbin

scarface
so listen up my niggaz and i ain't tryin' to preach
i'm just tellin' it from my side 'cause i'm in the streets
i done been there done that seen a whole neighborhood
destroyed by the government bein tipped off by one rat
he caught a dope case and they threatened him with time
he get his own fuckin' people jammed and he take the five
that's the shit there they ain't even catch him with dope
but they gave him thirty-five years cause the nigga done spoke
snitchin that's a motherfucker watch what you say
you don't know no-motherfuckin-body nigga you lame
watch your so-called homeboys keep to yourself
stay away from niggaz gettin' caught that get out of jail
don't talk about your business keep yo' thoughts in yo' head
and this game it got a paper trail watch where ya spend
don't write down names and numbers it's a memory thang
never shit where ya sleep keep the crib out of range
and plus you never let these niggaz know where you stay
'cause when the push turns to a shove they hit and you say
 true motherfuckin game true motherfuckin game

when ya hustle ain't evolvin
that's when niggaz start starvin
and when you niggaz start starvin
that's when you niggaz start robbin
when these niggaz got problems

everyday it's been the same old thang on my block
ya either workin or ya slangin cocaine on my block
ya had to hustle 'cause that's how we was raised on my block
and ya stayed on ya hop until ya made you a knot
on my block to hangout was the thang back then
and even when ya left out ya came back in
to my block from holloway belford to scotts
reed road the blocks we load the spots
smoke weed and rocks drink all the blue dots
on yo' block you probably bred a fat pat or tupac
or big pun or bi ya homeboys from knee-high
and even when it was stormin outside that nigga'd be by
that's me dawg on my block i ain't have to play the big shot
niggaz knew me back when i was stealin bell from shamrock
and my nickname was creepy if black june could see me
he'd be trippin' - and i'd bet he still try to tease me

my block - where everything is everything fa sheezy
my block - we probably done it all homey believe me
my block - we made the impossible look easy fa sheezy
my block - i'd never leave my block my niggaz need me

on my block we duck the nigga-haters and the cops
fuck a hotrod we race impalas chromed-out
on my block - it ain't no different than the next block
ya get drunk and pass out and they back ya to the house
and when you wake up on the couch you goin' right back at it
on my block when ya that fucked up they laugh at it
on my block it's just another day in the heart
of the southside of houston texas makin' ya mark
on my block we're cueing all the time playin' dominoes
keep the swishers sweet down until my mama goes
back inside -- then we can fight
pass it around a few times to get high

on my block everybody business ain't ya business
what's goin' on in this house is stayin here comprende?
on my block ya had to have that understanding
'cause if ya told ms mattie she went and told gladys
and once ya mama got it it was all on the wire
and when the word got back the set yo' ass on fire
on my block we got some 'nam vets shell-shocked
who never quite got right now they inhale rocks
on my block - it's like the world don't exist
we stay confined to this small little section with dividends
oh my block i wouldn't trade it for the world
'cause i love these ghetto boys and girls
born and raised on my block

5,"this song is about a nigga always trying to keep you down you know you got to
touch that
we made something from nothing
and vowed to never tear it apart
we turned the street hustle into an art
that would quickly change life forever for us
no more riding bikes or catching the bus
we on the roll up money to fold up
with cognac and cooked yola
got the neighborhood about to blow up but hold up
i see this van sittin' this old cat in a fitted
trying to get your little homey tore up
yo bruh we ain't working on this corner take your ass on dog
'fore you make me feed your ass to my hogs you fucking faggot
i know you want to catch me with this bag so you can hide me
or with my 44 so you can 45 me
you put this shit off in our neighborhoods and sweat us
and when you finally catch us up you give us letters
a cold thing
just when a nigga reach his gold man
you hand him a case for easing out the dope game
and i'm

watching us unfold with the times
he don't really want a nigga to climb
you'd rather separate me from my family forever
instead of trying to keep us together
you motherfuckers would rather keep me down

so what i rap about these streets
that don't make me be no less of a man
than a person that do work with his hands
it's bad enough i gots to deal with all these pressures that stand you tryin'
to make me stray away from my plan
know what i'm sayin'?
i'm from the gutter where all we had was one another
no wheat bread to butter from one bed to the other
all uncles and no brother
my mother's at work
my grandfather was my dad
and when he died it hurt
and as i hold back the tears my eye-wells swell
i been praying for heaven i been living in hell
and these niggas in my age group is dead or either locked up
the bitches no better they smoked out or knocked up
but i still love my hood that's where it started
ain't no hard feelings we partners nigga regardless
that's why you always see me coming around
'cause i could never turn my back on my town
but still i'm

money never changed me
money changed the people around
now they plot to try to keep me down
but still i rise like yeast
your whole conversation 'bout b
fuck a nigga talking 'bout me i'm a g
the realest motherfucker ever done it
you can't continue to pimp me and y'all eat from it
so fuck every soul who ever felt like i owed
them a god damn dime or a god damn rhyme or a god damn chance
motherfucker you sad
you a grown ass man holding a nigga hand
now get out on your own stop depending on your homes
to chuck you a bone and stop throwing stones
and that goes for everybody thinking it's them

it was swinging my arms bugging adrenaline pumping
oh shit this little nigga's thugging
i mean i was thirteen
i was nursing a knot on my face
but chose another time and a place
that i would avenge my last fight 'cause the same shit
ain't gonna happen that just happened last night
knuckle-game changed quicker than lighting
hit 'em or slice 'em
either stick 'em or blast pipes it's the fastlife
i tried to give another nigga advice shoot dice
do plenty of shit 'cause this life how many you get?
how many niggas do you know get two?
besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life-bid
be one in your crew
i don't respect killas i respect those with knowledge
codes of the streets got new rules but no guidance
lessons catch your mental to a young disciple
focus take care of your brothers niggas do as i do
keep your enemies close where they can see you
it not your enemy who get you

i'm down to play the real nigger shit to get with a bitch
but i'ma tell a motherfucker like this
you going good is what you come up against
nigger you get what you get
so the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
but any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench

i wanna walk with you follow in your footsteps
talk with you to find out where my good's kept
i been gone away from home for so long
seems like everything i try to do without you go wrong
i'm confused about a lot of things but not with my fate
so i'm depending on your holy ghost to guide me the way
see i'm a sinner in the 3rd degree
ain't afraid to admit it scause i seen niggas worse than me
who am i to judge a man when i'm a man myself
in the dark trying to get me some help
i went from pawn to king king back to pawn
doing my best to try to ease out the storm
i know that every tunnel's got an end and a light

but i don't question you i know that's your way ok
i know we living for the minute and there's a moment in time
we've got to leave here cause that's your design
and nothing lasts forever not even spirit only your word
that's what i live by 'cause that's what i heard
i wasn't there when you rose from the dead or parted the sea
i never seen you but still i believe
how you explain the moon the sky the stars and the rain
the sun and the sea the earth without form facing the deep
in darkness challenging the powers that be
it's impossible for scientists to make up the seas to make up the trees
so why we turn our backs on the truth?
it's heaven or hell the point we seem to hide from the youth
and i was singing this morning got touched by the spirit
so i wrote it down for the homies to hear it

they say a man is lost without a prayer without a song
so i'm singing on my knees 'cause i believe you'll keep me strong
until it's time for me to bring it home
but until it's time for me to bring it home
i'll be out in these streets hanging in the hood
even gangsters need to pray 'cause when i pray it's understood
that i got flaws about myself i can't make it by myself
i need the heaven's help i want to follow in your foot steps
done seen the strongest man bow down to a higher power
and given all his glory to god cause god towers
over all and in that i save this prayer
for all my homies that's been trapped out there
that's stuck in their ways it's different now than back in the days

water shootin' outta your eyes you hear this dude
and the voice is much louder than the voice that you
thought was the voice of the holy spirit
who changed your life when you hear it?
and the next morn' you wake up and the world look lighter
the grass greener and the sun brighter
i know the feelin' first hand i witnessed the sights
when i allowed the lord to come in my life
and it was like heaven heaven
but i'm a man i ain't perfect
that's a poor excuse that ain't workin'
i asked him for forgiveness for every sin i commit
hopefully he gonna let me stay on his list
and tryin' and get to heaven
america the beautiful don't be so cold
how do you expectin' our seeds gonna grow?
when you trap us in the ghetto
and show love to the other muthafuckers
while we right here starvin' at home
i'd cry if i thought that me sheddin' a tear might help
then again me sheddin' tears don't help
wanna call up to the president and see if he know help
let him know you up shit creek yourself we all sinners
facin' the winter with no socks and no shoes
in a position where we all gon' loose
tell the penitentiaries we gonna need more schools
or what the fuck is we gonna do?
sit around and let the world pass us by?
waitin' on a message from the revrand
and he ain't but another man tryin' to get to heaven",3

a little arguing's okay but not everyday
and if we can't communicate what we got decays
until the smell gets more pungent
to the point where we can't be seen in public
body parts fallin' apart a symbol of what things do
or better yet a symbol of what friends do they die
and together forever just sounds fly
that's how it sounded to me when i heard it
and slow motion was her lips as she worded

i'm smellin' your shit now don't know how to call
all i wanted was grounds for understanding
i ain't greedy but to hold your heart i gotta put my hand in why debate?
you think you can fit me in that anorexic space between love and hate?
i got all of the first one and none of the other

and when the lyrics leave the mouth they look like light beams
with wings attached to mic i say fly rhymes
read between the lines aire vast lines

i'm talking white picket fence and a family of vasts
they stand behind me and reflect reality
stage one- master of ceremonies
and when the seven magnificent walked in
raisin' hell to lower heaven
we explored all the crevices
brothers is mad i wear knowledge like a third degree burn
light the match put it to the rhyme book make sure it all fits in the urn
the cream of life beats and rhymes are butter

stupid you could say these masculine thoughts are homosexual
'cause they blow heads like that dead clothes designer
all men were created equal emcees are uneven
ask blind man steven if he's even seen how the sunset looks
that's something you couldn't feel with a braille book
i'm hear to smack your ear drum long so hum along

sick of waiting in line for my weekly chocolate ration
its bad health and industrial sadness
never helped by tofu franks or sadistic maggots
this addiction is more random
i walk door to door mormon style spitting my sick tantrums

with beats that have to be registered
as sex offenders represented to the public
i'll exfoliate your face with the acid inside my stomach
binge and purge we live in thirty second blurbs
and if consumers stopped existing we'd forget how to use words

out to plant life that sits and looks pretty
to attract curious intersection angels when in the city
that's below any self-respecting actress in a german schiester film
who gobbled doggie dick and human feces
my fingers tap buttons with sanctified awareness
from heart scan to pulse readings
this a voice from a dead dimension without astral projection

acme lab rat escape barely breathing through the heating vents

drum in my chest that beats on the opposite of the right
let me know i got a breath left
in this frigid fragile capsule
that allows you to fly south before the winter winds trap you
i wrap my hell i made it wet suit stitch
so i can swim through elevators crazy wet through piss
i'm just a pigeon with one mile left
that doggy-paddles through this bullshit ocean of death
and these rags-to-riches words will break bones
like the assassination of two birds with one stone

who'se to blame for the state i'm in - yours truly
i play my cards but somehow i can't win

listen i was taught that mistakes made with great intentions
were never sins but where life lessons begin

now that i'm 27 single father starting over yet again
i am who i have to forgive
lost my mumma to cancer closed a 10 year chapter shortly after
can't deny that was some shit
alone in this life would've been at my throat with a knife chop
were it not for my passion to live
follow my soul not that i don't know the penalty
but that's the legacy that i pass to my kids
heard of shining in the heat of the moment

and won my freedom the moment i realised that's what this

i can't believe my eyes lord
i don't know what i'm seeing
i done watched them smash into little pieces everything i've been building
i can't believe my ears lord
i don't know what i'm hearing

i heard they smash into little pieces everything i've been building

who'se to blame for the state i'm in
i play my cards but somehow i can't win",3
4,"one behind the next in line
it's inspection time let me check your design
your pedigree don't hold up next to mine
i'm a thouroughbred of the most excellent kind


brother ali and who's asking
the text book definition of brute passion
the future the past a true champion is born
never made and that's a label you can't pretend
i think better outside of the box
i rhyme better outside of the booth
there's no hiding the truth i'm the genuine positive proof

i buck shots through the roof set the hostages loose shoo
one might got to give real a minute
but it will recognize a alike once the beat finish
bleak grimacing winters led him to seek vengeance
with every bit the mystique of a street menace
self appointed judge with power vested
to hand down sentences from bus stop benches
he's relentless with his it's just in his spirit
you don't want to read about it fool you want to feel it

shit happens but i'm calm in a shit storm
its just normal what you think i balled up a fist for?
they probably thought i was born yesterday right
well mother fucker i stayed up all night
hit me hard like huh

oh the flow gon' cold cock you

you a born bitch local showboating impostor
i'm a known credited stone ghetto philosopher
i think very deeply i aspire to be free
read through these credentials of mine
i'm exquisite and only get better with time
and not yet in my prime
i age like wine and got a good goddamn head at the end of my spine
plus i live outside of those confines
meaning my expression is yet to be defined

y'all will never try putting ribbons in the sky
you would hit your head on that rooty-poot box you live inside
what you gon' do when the well runs dry
human beings grown images just get old
so when we get old you gon' be out in the cold
and i'ma still keep chasing what i'm owed

take a breath to check the pedigree
check the pedigree",3
5,"my friend give me a minute here
you have no idea how to frame me
brother ali is this brother ali is that
you ain't been right yet
so ok i'll do it myself

ant you got me?

big brother the beast i'm showing my teeth
feel it all in the air it's too potent to breathe
explosive with the free got a heavy one i wrote up my sleeve
i could post up or go for the three
versatile with it i'm grinding until i get it
mindless of the defined limits or consequences

i defy critics i ain't scientific
i find my intrinsic vibe and i ride with it
vocals no nothing other than soul touching
so if they land in yours it's just a home-coming
if they don't go there they might perish
land on deaf ears but die unembarassed
you don't need to hear my race in the song
you hear the plane that i'm on
your whole face change when i'm on

your ears might help you see
fuck hearing me i need you to feel like me

daylight
let the dark side slide right on out you
don't deny it announce it to the daylight
let it get inside of you 'cause you're not alive
until you open up your eyes

i never asked my brothers to put that crown on me
now they want to frown on me look down on me
pardon me i don't think i'm hurting anybody
just because i took shahadah but i'm cursing at the party
ain't showing i'm holy just showing the whole me
y'all just pretend to be whatever your role be
don't get me wrong preist and rabbi innam

but maybe that's why the masses don't respond
can't sit and nit pick but miss the big shit
expect us not to see the contradictions
want us to listen and join your religion
i ain't got a pot to piss in who y'all kidding
i believe in the qu'ran and all that's within it
the concepts and all of the prophets that are mentioned
but i talk directly to god so if i'm sinning
y'all ain't got nothing to do with me repenting

if i'm an open book this is how i'm supposed to look
i got to show it all and don't be shook
so they ask me if i'm black or white i'm neither
race is a made up thing i don't believe in it
my genes tie me to those that despised me
made a living killing the ones that inspired me

i ain't just talking about singing and dancing
i was taught life and manhood by black men
so i'm a product of that understanding
and a small part of me feels like i am them
does that make me a liar maybe
but i don't want the white folks that praise me to think they can claim me
'cause you didn't make me
you don't appreciate what i know to be great yet you relate to me
and that frustrates me and what can i say

'cause i know that i benefit from something i hate
but make no mistake our connection ain't fake
it's never too late to clear off the slate
you follow my tape then you know what i'm about
if something comes up then it must come out",3
6,"ain't no where to run to
there ain't nothing here for free

if i don't like my life i gut it and rebuild it
fuck it keep nothing but god and my children
i kill the devil wherever he resides
even if he hiding in me he got to die
i killed little jason he was only fifteen
sewed his good traits together made ali
filled his lungs with the koran until he breathe
let him walk but kept him on a short leash
here he stand now seventeen year old man-child
ain't ask nobody for a muh-fuckin' hand out
he trying to carry heaven on his back
jumped the broom with a stranger he ain't never look back
what he know about how the world spin?
bless his heart he a virgin never even had a girlfriend
want to be a man so bad that he can taste it
his family fell apart and he's tryin' to replace it
you'll find in him a heart that is second to none
but i know old soul that his lessons ain't done so
i stand willing to kill him again
if to grow he got to shed his skin then let it be done

ain't no where to run to
there ain't nothing here for free
you'll see what i see and know that freedom ain't free

one half of all the two-leggeds on the scene are too timid to dream
'cause failure is far too depressing it would seem
so they take what's given
that's your decision i just don't consider that livin'
shit if i'mma die whether or not i try
i might as well let the dice fly
i'm hot knife through butter in the night sky
it shouldn't take a genius to see this hunger in my eye
so i use blood and sweat to butter my bread
'cause this cold world couldn't give a fuck if i'm fed
i ain't curled up in my bed
if i don't set the world ablaze trust it ain't 'cause of nothing i did
listen i don't think god's obligated to touch you
if your ass would rather live in shit than work a shovel
i refuse to let the sun set on me again
till the end i'm a one man army friend

7,"i got a letter from the government the other day
i opened and read and burned that man
the way that i live don't concern that man
we gon' have to settle this another way

when the knuckles turn white and the eyes begin bulging
i take an honest look at my life its insulting
and i been sulking about it all week
hearing the dull screech of metal grinding the concrete
and sparks dance where the worst of both worlds clash
meaning the blue tyrants and my broke ass
i understand this is pawn take pawn shit
but i'll be damned if you shoot me on my lawn bitch
think twice before shining that light
in my drawers in the alley in the middle of the night
garbage bag and house shoes put two and two together
i ain't no drug smuggler i'm a struggling brother
i have this dream where i go nuts
dial 911 from the roof and post up
decorate your hard head when you came in the cruiser
and paint your rod red in the name of abruka

what kind of sucker would i have to be after these years
of you harassing and attacking me to run and join your cavalry
imagine me all gi joe'd up in afghanistan somewhere prepared to go nuts
you clinically crazy if you think you could pay me
a figure that could make me slay these innocent babies
i identify with a slave wishing to break free
he was victimised by the same system that raped me
look at us poor just trying to get our foot in the door
and unfortunately hooked in this war
we were both coerced to get enlisted
but his was with a trigger mine was living conditions
we're one in the same but in the name of some freedom
i'm supposed to put one in his brain like something will change
what freedom? i ain't writing for no president
send the kids to die when we didn't even elect the bitch

listen i'm in no position to judge a young stud
tryn'a use the military to come the fuck up
'cause self preservation is the first law of nature
play your cards smart remember what the fucks up
its really no different from crack pedaling when it
comes to dying and killing for a dream you were given
last thing in your mind is how you seen by the system
n' be willing to go to those extremes for your vision
shit i'm no smarter i'm fucking retarded
i just know enough to not eat directly where the dog shits
if uncle sam wants to threaten my health
tell him he have to come and get me himself

woman i gave you the grand tour
there's no reason for you to look closer
but you do so i show you
it ain't pretty here now but it will be
one day i promise when the sun rays are honest
i chip away at the tint on the windows
stain in the glass it's a pain in the ass
i scrape and i scratch till my arms grow weary
meanwhile i warned you not to stand near me
i think i built the fence a little late
the demons were already in now they can't escape
i've been toe to toe with most of em' though
as a whole they must perish in order for me to grow
huddled in the gloomy little cracks that they inhabit
they pass away the day i deactivate my habits
each one gets buried in the backyard
in tiny little graves marked only by a black scar
kindly watch your step
this silence isn't finished being awkward yet
trophies lay in the basement to stay safe
today's mistakes are in a lighted trophy case though

and i want you to know
i only invited you 'cause i ain't thought you would show
but i'll be damned if you ain't grab my hand
and presented yourself from the threshold of the heartland

are you here to confuse me x2
i don't mean to confuse you x2

you'll notice antique swords adorn the walls
they're really not here for decoration at all
i save them shits from old relationships
and i swing 'em at you later if you stay in the mix
don't you realize nobody's really been inside here
since it was last drenched in dry tears
decorating was a senseless idea
'cause only the blind lonely prince resides here
we dine here on a balanced diet
ego when it's loud self-hatred when it's quiet
inside the castle this is what the life is
sign here after you read the fine print
it's not much but all of it's yours
take great caution if you want to explore
watch your head when you opening the doors
and always remember that the choice was yours

straighten me out right quick
i like it so far man

yeah

come on let's go

welcome to the united snakes
land of the thief home of the slave
grand imperial guard
where the dollar is sacred and proud

let's do this shit for real come on now

smoke and mirrors stripes and stars
stoning for the cross in the name of god
bloodshed genocide rape and fraud
writ into the pages of the law good lord

the cold continent latchkey child
ran away one day and started acting foul
king of where the wild things are daddy's proud
cause the roman empire done passed it down

imported and tortured a workforce
and never healed the wounds or shook the curse off
now the grown up goliath nation
holding open auditions for the part of david can you feel it?

nothing can save you you question the reign
you get rushed in and chained up
fists raised but i must be insane
'cause i can't figure a single goddamn way to change it

but welcome to the united snakes
land of the thief home of the slave
the grand imperial guard
where the dollar is sacred and power is god

welcome to the united snakes
land of the thief home of the slave
the grand imperial guard
where the dollar is sacred and power is god

all must bow to the fat and lazy
the fuck you obey me and why do they hate me who me
only two generations away from the
world's most despicable slavery trade

pioneered so many ways to degrade a human being
that it can't be changed to this day
legacy so ingrained in the way that we think
we no longer need chains to be slaves

lord it's a shameful display
the overseers even got raped along the way
cause the children can't escape from the pain
and they born with the poisonous hatred in their veins

try and separate a man from his soul
you only strengthen him and lose your own
but shoot that fucker if he walk near the throne
remind him that this is my home now i'm gone

welcome to the united snakes
land of the thief home of the slave
the grand imperial guard
where the dollar is sacred and power is god

welcome to the united snakes
land of the thief home of the slave
the grand imperial guard
where the dollar is sacred

hold up gimme one right here hold up

you don't give money to the bums
on the corner with a sign bleeding from their gums
talking about you don't support a crackhead
what you think happens to the money from your taxes?

shit the government's an addict
with a billion dollar a week kill-brown-people habit
and even if you ain't on the front line
when massa yell crunch time you right back at it

you ain't look at how you hustling backwards
at the end of the year add up what they subtracted
three out of twelve months your salary
paid for that madness man that's sadness

what's left? get a big assed plasma
to see where they made dan rather point the damn camera
only approved questions get answered
now stand your ass up for that national anthem

welcome to the united snakes

the grand imperial guard
where the dollar is sacred and power is god

ps you can keep all this shit
and hang around your broke friends and call yourself rich
struggling i did with you was all for nothing
it was never enough your heart set on suffering
i admit that i was weak in the beginning
i wanted someone to need me instead of a friendship
i didn't think i deserved a true partner
so i transferred the arrangement i had with my momma

maybe seeing this door slam will get it through you head
i don't love you i don't think i ever did

hope you find a happy ending to your story someday

round and round and round we used to go
i never fucked you right or made enough bread i know
if i'm such a bastard and mistreated you so
then how is it you're losing your mind to see me go?
truth be told i held you together
for all them years and i cheated on you never
defended your honor took in your momma
when she tried to rehab and had your back through the drama
you've got a sick stone under your ribs
where a heart is supposed to live
sick twisted and vindictive with your windows dim
baby in that wicked hardboiled fist you must shiver
how you threaten to kill the most precious
gift that you'll ever be blessed with
unless you're twisted demented and depressed as shit
and alone 'cause you faithfully slayed your friendships
since you never listened to a word i ever said
maybe seeing this door slam will get it through your head

we live learn and figure it out
i just pray that you don't remember us sleepin' on the floor
and me cleanin mouse droppings out of your toys
it took alot of hard work for us to get where we at

just know that it hurts me to death when i leave and go tourin

i'm scared that it might make you feel unimportant
but our bond is so strong that the moment i get off
we seem to pick right back up where we left off
i try to say that i do it for you

so if i ever come home and feel that i've hurt us as friends
i swear to god that i'll never tour again
i ain't never met a child quite like you
words don't suffice for me to describe you

you have a genuine goodness inside you

i'm not a hunter but i am told
that uh in places like in the arctic
where indiginous people sometimes might might hunt a wolf
they'll take a double edged blade
and they'll put blood on the blade
and they'll melt the ice and stick the handle in the ice
so that only the blade is protruding
and that a wolf will smell the blood and wants to eat
and it will come and lick the blade trying to eat
and what happens is when the wolf licks the blade
of course he cuts his tongue and he bleeds
and he thinks he's really having a good thing
and he drinks and he licks and he licks
and of course he is drinking his own blood and he kills himself
that's what the imperialists did with us with crack cocaine
you have these young brothers out there who think they are getting something
they gonna make a living with
they is getting something they can buy a car
like the white people have cars why can't i have a car?
they getting something they can get a piece of gold
white people have gold why can't i have gold?
they getting something to get a house
white people have a house why can't i have a house?
and they actually think that there's something that's bringing resources to them
but they're killing themsleves just like the wolf was licking the blade
and they're slowly dying without knowing it
that's what's happening to the community you with me on that?
that's exactly precisely what happens to the community
and instead of blaming the hunter who put the damn handle and the blade in the ice
for the wolf
that what happens is the wolf gets the blame gets the blame for trying to live
that's what happens in our community
you don't blame the person the victim
you blame the oppressor imperialism white power is the enemy
was the enemy when it first came to africa
and snatched up the first african brothers here against our will
isss the enemy today

you have the emergence in human society
of this thing that's called the state
what is the state? the state is this organized bureaucracy
it is the po-lice department it is the army the navy
it is the prison system the courts and what have you
this is the state -- it is a repressive organization
but the state -- and gee well you know
you've got to have the police cause
if there were no police look at what you'd be doing to yourselves
you'd be killing each other if there were no police
but the reality is
the police become necessary in human society
only at that junction in human society
where it is split between those who have and those who ain't got

narrator
once upon a time
there was a very serious situation growing
there was a farmer and a farmyard filled with animals
and this is the story of their times

old man sammy had a farm
walked the land with the wife
most of the time shit was calm
his whole life was maintained off the everyday labor
from the mules in the field to the cattle in the stable
this is how we kept food on this table maxing
you would have thought he was disabled by the way he be relaxing
acting like mr magnificent
but the animals were thinking something different
the sentiment was tension in the barnyard
throughout the years they had been through mad drama
with the farmer word is bond
and they all came to one conclusion
they argued there was no way they'd ever be free
if it was up to humans
therefore the only course left was revolution which was understandable
and since the pigs promised to lead in the interest of all the animals
they planned a full attack
under the leadership of hannibal
the fattest pig in the pack
the next morning on the farm
everything was calm
just before dawn
but before long
the sun got so hot it made the farm seem electric
now check it
this is when that shit got hectic
directed by hannibal the animals attacked
old sam was in a state of shock
and fell up on his back
and dropped his rifle
reaching in vain
each and every creature from the field at his throat
screaming kill feel the pain

this is the animal in man
this is the animal in you
this is the animal in man
coming true 2x

after they ran the farmer off the farm
the pigs went around and called a meeting in the barn
hannibal spoke for several hours
but when he talked about his plans for power
that's when the conversation turned sour
he issued an official ordinance to set
if you not a pig from this day forth then you're subordinate
that's when the horses went buck wild
one of them shouted out
you fraudulent pigs we know your fucking style
hannibal's face was flushed and pale
all the animals eyes full of disgust and betrayal
he felt the same way sam felt
they took his tongue out of his mouth
and cut his body up for sale for real for real

let me now turn to our program for the future
the economy right now is extremely supportive of the president and his policies
fbi scientists have found chemical traces consistent with a bomb or a missile on a piece of wreckage
police using clubs and tear gas against demonstrators
they called me a mother-bleeped out-ing so-and-so and a white fascist like they said 'you're getting some of your own medicine'

singing
telling lies to our children
telling lies to our children
telling lies to our babies
only truth can take us

you can't fool all the people all of the time
but if you fool the right ones then the rest will fall behind
tell me who's got control of your mind? your world view?
is it the news or the movie you're taking your girl to? uh
know what i'm sayin' cause uncle sam got a plan
if you examine what they tellin' us then you will understand
what they plantin' in the seeds of the next generation
feeding our children miseducation
no one knows if there's ufo's or any life on mars
or what they do when they up in the stars
because i don't believe a word of what the president said
he filling our head with lies got us hypnotised
when he be speaking in code words about crime and poverty
drugs welfare prisons guns and robbery
it really means us there's no excuse for the slander
but what's good for the goose is still good for the gander
see

i don't believe
bob marley died from cancer
31 years ago i woulda been a panther
they killed huey 'cause they
knew he had the answer

and grab the intercom my first words will be
i believe man made god outta ignorance and fear
if god made man then why the hell would he put us here?
i thought he's supposed to be the all loving
the same god who let hitler put the jews in the oven
we don't fall for the regular shit they try to feed us
all this half-ass leadership flippin' position
they turn politician and shut the hell up and follow tradition
for your tv screen is telling lies to your vision
every channel got some brainwashed cop shit to watch
running up in niggas cribs claiming that they heard shots
it's a plot but busta
can you tell me who's greedier?
big corporations the pigs or the media?
sign of the times terrorism on the rise
commercial airplanes falling out the sky like flies
make me wonder what secrets went down with bob brown ?
who burnt churches to the ground with no evidence found?
it's not coincidence it's been too many studied incidents
it coulda been the klan who put that bomb at the olympics
but it probably was the fbi deep at the call
'cause if they make us all panic then they can start martial law

i don't believe bob marley died from cancer
31 years ago i woulda been a panther
they killed huey 'cause they knew he had the answer
the views that you see in the news is muthafuckin propaganda

uh we view each other uh with uh a great love and a great understanding

oppressed people all over the world and i think that uh we differ from
uhmm uh some other groups simply because we understand the system better

the story of my life

if i could start from scratch i wouldn't change shit
same red bandana same 45th
same g-wagon same hood-rat bitch
workers in the kitchen cookin' up my shit

same telephone booth same connect
that mean the same hollow tips breakin' up in my chest
same bloody t-shirt same address
same dog food album bangin' in my tape deck

homie if i could make '94 today
i'd tell eazy and dre to bring back nwa
i would have told pac not to stomp orlando
told puffy and big about the rampart scandal

i got too many dead homies fuck a rap career
i'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga tez
seem like we was jus' in magic city yesterday
if i could bring back my homeboy charles he would say

if i could start my life from scratch
if i could take away the pain off my past
if i had another chance i would do just that
i'd give anything just to go right back

if i could start my life from scratch
if i could take away the pain off my past
if i had another chance i would do just that
i'd give anything just to go right back

homie if i could rewind the hands of time
i would have cut of the ps2 at 1249
nigga i'm a gangsta i stay on my grind
who knew 11 minutes later i'd get shot wit my own 9

i was 2 beeps away from a flat-line
when you a bad boy niggas don't wanna see you shine
dre said it's my turn he called it game time
23 lexanis bitches call 'em lebron's

i'd give my own life if i could change god's mind
bring baby luny back at the drop of a dime
he let off a whole k got shot 1 time
that was a cool nigga i wish he had 9 lives

my brother devon died 'cause he chased a cat
it's a dog eat dog world jesus please holla back
i got a confession to make its called payback
if y'all don't wanna listen show me where pastor ma$e at

if i could start my life from scratch
if i could take away the pain off my past
if i had another chance i would do just that
i'd give anything jus' to go right back

if i could start my life from scratch
if i could take away the pain off my past
if i had another chance i would do just that
i'd give anything jus' to go right back

i would have told big will it rain every tuesday and thursday
when pigeons in your coupe you gotta watch where your birds lay
would have told vita to stay sober
when niggas beg for mercy that mean the beef is over

told meesh to take the porsche back drive a rover
told slim hit reverse on that hardtop nova
i would've change a couple of lines when i wrote soldier
so i wouldn't have to live lookin' over my shoulder

my life is like an impala ridin' 3 wheel motion
i've been front to back side to side
level my 6 4 frame out keep on rollin'
keep your family far away and your enemies closer

picture the source suckin' benzino's dick
tryna be the big fish in the pond you know how them piranhas get
you dead when dat green line go flat
if you could start your life from scratch you couldn't change that

if i could start my life from scratch
if i could take away the pain off my past
if i had another chance i would do just that
i'd give anything jus' to go right back

if i could start my life from scratch

verse 1 - game dre
what happened in hip hop
that got pac and big shot
the thicks plots
now every rapper claim
he let his clique pop
but even myself tote a gun
and know to run then get shot
i've been there before
now i'm fuckin' with doc
gotta do them calvin broadus numbers
if not i push rocks
anticipatin my encarceration
media think i'm fakin like mason
but when it comes to mase
fuck off kelly i don't take it in the face
i find out who sprayed it
i'm putting you under the pavement
no buddhist priest catholic or baptist pastor can save him
i'm far from religious
but i got beliefs so i put
cannary yellow diamonds
in my jesus piece
i came back from the dead
without a part of my chest
layed in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
i waited for 3 years
while everybody else dropped
now i understand why nas
did a song with his pops

i'm ready to die
without a reasonable doubt
smoke chronic and hit it
doggy style before i go out
until they sign my death certificate
all eyez on me
i'm still at it illmatic
and that's the documentary

if i die my niggas fuck it
i did a song with mary blige my niggas
got a hook from faith
no verse from jay
i guess on westside story
he thought i spit in his face
told ed lover and money luv
i was talkin' to ja
with that mayback line
it was payback time
keep fuckin' with me nigga
ill put you under me

come home sit in the thrown
with my legs crossed
and my air force
middle finger up
fuck the world
'cause i'm feelin' like puff
when life after death hit
mo' money mo' problems
and i lost my best friend
i'm the second dopest nigga

game commentator
you know what speakin' of jay

respect for jay

i never take shots at legends

verse 3 - game busta

cause moms was a hoover crip
first day i got signed
i had to prove i spit
freestyle with busta rhymes
son duke is sick

i could finally put the shoes on
now that the rumors of rakim and q gone
they say truth hurts
sunk like quick sand
don't stop me in traffic
and ask about hitman
i gotta restore the feelin'
it crawled from under the rock
after the dog pound
crushed the buildings
i got a family to feed
i'm the middle of 9 children
we can talk about a loan
after i sell 5 million
if i tell you i ain't game
and i don't know dre
you gonn do me like x-zibit
and cut half of my face?
i take all the credit
for putting the west
back on the map
if you ain't feelin' that
guess i'm gorilla black

i'm ready to die
without a reasonable doubt
smoke chronic and hit it

verse 2 the game

they say every time somebody die a child is born
so i thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son
1132 she screaming at the top of her lungs
i'm panicking nurse yelling for the doctor to come
all i could remember was lamaze class breathe baby
one one two two three three four four i see the head
doc busting through the door he between the legs
he see the head it's my baby boy
1146 the head out she screaming making crazy noise
pain is love my stomach folding like a la-z-boy
i'm feeling like mariah carey all these butterfly's
voices singing to me sound like teena marie
i'm calling niggas on tour jayo tell spiz i just cut the umbilical cord
1157 a soldier is born and he's flesh of my flesh young harlem karan

chorus busta rhymes

i hope you grow up to become that everything you can be

but in the end i hope you only turn out better than me
i hope you know i love you young'n like father like son

my little man your day is coming coming your day is coming i tell you
and when it comes just keep it running running just keep it running i tell you

verse 3 the game

i wanna thank dr af and nurse theresa for bringing my baby boy to life
you birthed a caesar and my baby mama aliska
for pushing out a 10-pound 4-ounce mini-me i still can't believe it
nose ears eyes chin just like your daddy
i die before you grow up and be just like your daddy or your grandfather
call uncle zip tell him i got a son and i ain't even in harlem
i'm popping cris with your godfathers baron davis and d-mack darius rogers
drop the top on the '71 with my face in the clouds lord spare my son
and watch over aaron wright t'yan and lil' pun
lowriding banging ready to die track number 1
if i bust 5 times and they never see the sun
my life is a black hole like the barrel of a gun one

chorus busta rhymes

i hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
that's all i wanted for you young'n like father like son

but in the end i hope you only turn out better than me
i hope you know i love you young'n like father like son

my little man your day is coming coming your day is coming i tell you
and when it comes just keep it running running just keep it running i tell you

i hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
that's all i wanted for you young'n like father like son

but in the end i hope you only turn out better than me
i hope you know i love you young'n like father like son

my little man your day is coming coming your day is coming i tell you
and when it comes just keep it running running just keep it running i tell you",3
